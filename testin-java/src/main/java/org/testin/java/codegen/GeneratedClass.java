 * <p>
 * The class a test set's generated code lives in: found, or written out where it
 * is not there yet.
 * <p>
 * The twin of {@link GeneratedMethod}, and the same kind of owner - that one
 * answers which method belongs to a test case, this one which class belongs to a
 * test set. It takes the same arguments as {@link JavaSourceRoot#classFile},
 * because it is the PSI side of exactly that call.
 * <p>
 * <b>Writing the class writes the path.</b> Nothing in Testin creates a Java
 * package on its own: a folder in the tree is test data that names a package,
 * not a request to write one. The folders come into being when a class needs
 * them, which {@code JavaSourceRoot.packageFolder} does with one
 * {@code createDirectoryIfMissing} for the whole chain - so no caller here has a
 * package to make first.
 * <p>
 * One owner because the create generator had this privately and the move
 * generator did not, and the two disagreed about the same situation: a test case
 * pasted into a test set with no class got a method when it was a copy, because
 * creating one creates the class, and lost its method when it was a cut, because
 * the move looked the class up and gave up. Same gesture, same destination, two
 * answers.
