# UC-EDITOR-PANEL-004: Change a grid column's width

**As a** tester, **I want** to widen the column I am reading, **so that** a long expected result is not cut off every
time I open the editor.

This is only about the grid. Cards have no columns.

There is no key for this. Drag the divider in the header.

## Rules

- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-001** — A test set opens in one editor and a test run in
  another. Both are the same shape: a toolbar on top, the rows in the middle, a
  status bar at the bottom.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-002** — Both editors open showing cards. The grid is built
  the first time the tester asks for it.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-003** — A card is drawn to the width of the list. A title
  too long for that width wraps onto more lines, and the cards never scroll
  sideways.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-004** — A page holds 50 test cases until the tester says
  otherwise. The most a page can hold is 1000.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-005** — What the tester types is stored exactly. Testin
  may draw it differently, and never saves the drawn form.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-006** — A save that would leave the file as it is writes
  nothing, and says nothing.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-007** — Each editor keeps an undo history of its own, kept
  against the test set it is showing, and the tree keeps another.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-008** — Every change confirms itself with one message in
  the past tense. A change to several test cases gets one message with a count.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-009** — Moving the view says nothing and changes nothing.
  Paging, filtering, searching and opening the details panel are all silent.
  None of them throws a filter away: a test case the filter is hiding is
  reported rather than brought into view.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-010** — While a grid cell is open for editing, every key
  that would act on the row is refused.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-025** — A width the tester dragged is remembered, and
  comes back the next time the grid is built.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-026** — Only a drag saves a width. A column Testin sized
  itself is not remembered.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-027** — A column Testin sizes is made as wide as its
  content needs, up to 500 points.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-248** — A button that turns gray while the pointer is on
  it loses its hover look at once, so a control that has stopped working never
  looks ready to press.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-249** — A grid that held the keyboard when it was rebuilt
  holds it again afterward, so the next key lands in the grid rather than
  nowhere.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-250** — A grid row is drawn in its stripe, or in the
  selection color while it is selected, and in nothing else. The pointer passing
  over it changes nothing.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-251** — When the status bar is too narrow for everything,
  the figures on the right give way first, then the sentence on the left down to
  a short floor, and the page arrows keep their width to the last.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-252** — A badge's words are printed white or dark,
  whichever reads on its color, so a pale badge never carries white text.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-257** — An editor narrower than its toolbar or its status
  bar scrolls that bar sideways under the pointer, with the mouse wheel or a
  touchpad. No scrollbar is shown and the bar keeps its height, so nothing on it
  is cut off and the editor below does not move.

## What the tester sees

This opens no screen. The tester drags the divider between two column headers,
and the column follows the pointer as it moves. The rows below grow or shrink to
fit the new width.

Nothing is said. No message appears and no dialog opens.

## Main flow

1. The tester drags the divider between two column headers.
2. The column changes width, and every row is measured again.
3. The width is remembered against that column of that kind of editor.
4. Every later grid opens with that column at that width.

## What Testin refuses

Nothing. Any width can be dragged.

## What is remembered separately

A width is remembered per column name and per kind of editor. The Description
column in a test set editor and the Description column in a test run editor are
remembered apart, so the two can be different widths.
