[Documentation](../README.md) › The editor panel

# The editor panel

The editor panel is the middle of the IDE, where a test set or a test run opens
in a tab. It is where test cases are written, and where a test run is executed.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Part of Testin** | The editor panel |
| **Answers** | What a tester can do to test cases and to a test run, exactly what happens step by step, and what every screen looks like |
| **Numbering** | Use cases are `UC-EDITOR-PANEL-001` to `UC-EDITOR-PANEL-047`. Rules are `Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-001` to `Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-214` |

## The use cases

Two editors share this panel. A test set opens in one, a test run in the other.
They share the toolbar, the status bar, the two views and every key that is not
about a verdict.

## What the panel is for

The tree says what exists. The editor is where the work happens.

A test set opens as a list of its test cases, and the tester writes them there.
A test run opens as the same list with a verdict beside each row, and the tester
walks it, judging each test case in turn.

Everything else in the panel exists to make those two things fast: two views of
the same rows, a filter, a search, and a key for every gesture.

**Five words, before the rules use them.**

- A **card** is one test case drawn as a block, with its description on top and
  its fields under it.
- The **grid** is the same test cases drawn as a table, one row each.
- A **field** is one thing a test case carries, such as its expected result.
- A **verdict** is what a test run records against one test case: **Passed**,
  **Failed** or **Blocked**.
- To **execute** a test run is to walk it test case by test case, recording a
  verdict for each.

1. **The toolbar** — create, refresh, choose the fields shown, filter, switch
   view, search, and the test set's own details.
2. **A card** — its number in the test set, then its description, then a badge
   for the priority and one for each group.
3. **The detail lines** — one for each field the tester chose to show.
4. **The status bar, left** — how many test cases are selected, of how many, and
   how many the filter hid.
5. **The status bar, middle** — first page, previous, which page of how many,
   next, last.
6. **The status bar, right** — how many test cases a page holds.

## The test run editor

The same shape, with three things added.

1. **Start Manual Execution** — the first button. It becomes **Stop Execution**
   while a run is going.
2. **Light mode** — the always on top window, on [its own page](lightMode.md).
3. **The run status** — on the right of the status bar, with the tree's own
   icon.
4. **The figures** — one for each verdict any test case carries. A verdict
   nobody recorded is not drawn.
5. **The clock** — how long this test run has been executing. It ticks once a
   second.

## Why the panel is built this way

**Two views of one list.** Cards are for reading one test case properly. The
grid is for comparing many and correcting them quickly. Both draw the same
rows, and the selection follows from one to the other.

**The grid is built late.** A test set of 2,770 test cases would cost a table
nobody asked for. The grid is built the first time the tester presses the
button.

**A key for everything a tester does often.** Executing a test run is `P`, `F`
and `B` and nothing else. The gestures a tester does twice a project, such as
switching view or refreshing, are buttons.

**One message per gesture.** Twenty test cases removed is *Removed 20*, not
twenty messages. Two places break this and they are named below.

## Where the plugin breaks its own rules, writing test cases

Stated, not hidden. Each one is real and can be met today. None of them has a
bug report yet.

| | The rule it breaks | What a tester sees |
|---|---|---|
| **Difference 6** | Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-008 — one message with a count | Fixed. Pasting or cutting a block raises one message with the number of cells written. The writes of one gesture all happen in one event, so they are counted together without the clipboard actions having to know about it. |
| **Difference 7** | Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-005 — what the tester typed is stored | A description typed into a grid cell loses characters Testin will not keep. If nothing else changed, nothing is saved and nothing is said, and the tester watches their text change. |
| **Difference 9** | Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-005 — a key works the same on every machine | `Ctrl+M` is not made into `Cmd+M` on a Mac, though `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+F` are. The empty editor's second line reads *Press Ctrl+M to add* whatever machine it is on. |
| **Difference 15** | Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-008 — one word for one act | Dragging cards says *Re-sorted*. Moving a test case by typing its number says *Updated*. The same act, two words. |

## Where the plugin breaks its own rules, executing a test run

| | The rule it breaks | What a tester sees |
|---|---|---|
| **Difference 19** | Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-008 — a signed off test run records nothing more | The status bar's own tooltip says a completed or closed test run records no more verdicts. `P`, `F` and `B` still record one, still save it, and still say *Passed*. Only the automation refuses. |
| **Difference 25** | Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-008 — one message with a count | Fixed. An automated run says nothing per test case and one line when it has nothing left to report — *Passed 42, Failed 8*. The words are the status bar's own, so the balloon and the bar cannot count one run differently. |
| **Difference 26** | Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-005 — what the tester typed is kept | An automated pass still clears the actual result, the error, the bug severity and the bug priority the tester wrote by hand. It now says so afterwards, in a message that stays in the notification list. The dialog that asks first is still on the manual path only. |

**Fixed since this list was written.** The numbers are left out rather than
closed up, so an issue that quotes one still points at the right thing.

| Gone | Was |
|---|---|
| **Difference 10** | Selecting a test case the filter was hiding threw every filter away, silently. Fixed 7 September 2026, [#205](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/205) |
| **Difference 13** | **Refresh** threw away every filter and the search text, and said only *Refreshed*. Fixed 7 September 2026, [#208](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/208) |
| **Difference 14** | A card dragged between two visible cards landed after whatever the filter was hiding between them. Fixed 7 September 2026, [#209](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/209) |
| **Difference 20** | A filtered walk completed the whole test run and turned every other pending test case untested. Fixed 7 September 2026, [#214](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/214) |
| **Difference 21** | **Start Manual Execution** was live on a test run holding no test cases and on a filter matching nothing, and pressing it marked the test run **In Progress**. Fixed 7 September 2026, [#215](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/215) |
| **Difference 22** | The walk landed on test cases that already had a verdict, timed them again, and re-stamped who judged them and when. Fixed 7 September 2026 |
| **Difference 23** | A test run whose every test case was judged from the menu or the keyboard stayed **In Progress**. Only an automated verdict completed it. Fixed 7 September 2026, [#217](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/217) |
| **Difference 24** | **Refresh** stopped an execution and said only *Refreshed*. Fixed 7 September 2026, [#218](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/218) |
| **Difference 27** | Stopping a test case marked the test run **In Progress** first, and so did clicking the icon that only navigates to the test method. Fixed 7 September 2026, [#221](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/221) |
| **Difference 28** | Closing the tab left the automation running and its verdicts homeless. Fixed 7 September 2026, [#222](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/222) |
| **Difference 29** | `Escape` in the failure dialog threw away everything typed with no confirmation. Fixed 7 September 2026, [#223](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/223) |
| **Difference 2** | **Test Data** and **Pre Conditions** were drawn in the create dialog with no key that opened either. Fixed 8 September 2026, [#198](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/198) |
| **Difference 16** | `Shift+Enter` saved a bulk edit and the strip named only `Enter`. Fixed 9 September 2026, [#211](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/211) |
| **Difference 3** | The group tick boxes read **REGRESSION** where every other surface reads **Regression**, because the box's own text was the group's identity. Fixed 9 September 2026, [#199](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/199) |
| **Difference 5** | Two buttons on one toolbar were both tooltipped **Details**. The one that picks what a card shows is **Fields**, which is what this document already called it. Fixed 9 September 2026, [#201](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/201) |
| **Difference 11** | The page size box answered a different number without a word. A number outside the range now says what the range is; a blank box or letters asked for nothing and still say nothing. Fixed 9 September 2026, [#206](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/206) |
| **Difference 18** | The status bar read *0 of 12 test cases* with nothing selected, putting a position where a tester reads a count. It says the count alone now. Fixed 9 September 2026, [#213](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/213) |
| **Difference 1** | `Ctrl+C` said *Details copied* and copied one line, the description, because `Can.COPY` was declared on that one attribute of eighteen. It copies the ten fields the tester writes now, and drops the ones they left empty (Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-207). Fixed 10 September 2026, [#197](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/197) |
| **Difference 4** | The filter offered eight groups and the create dialog three, so Security, UI, Functional and Validation could be filtered on and never typed - while an import, a paste, a Git merge and a bulk edit all put them on a test case perfectly well. The dialog offers every group now, and the `active` flag that held four of them back is gone, along with an `assignable` flag nothing ever read. Fixed 10 September 2026, [#200](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/200) |
| **Difference 8** | An unreadable priority became the lowest and an unreadable status kept the old value - two columns, two answers to a typo, both silent. All four parsed columns refuse now and keep what was there, and the message names the text and the column (Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-206). Fixed 9 September 2026, [#204](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/204) |
| **Difference 30** | `Ctrl+Right` turned the page here and moved to the next test case in the view panel, and the constant behind both was called `NextTestCase` while the editor used it for pages - so the code disagreed with itself and the key reference listed the key twice with two meanings. The key is one gesture, forward in whichever surface has the keyboard, and the constant is called `Next`. Fixed 10 September 2026, [#224](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/224) |
| **Difference 12** | Unticking **Order** stopped three gestures in the grid: clicking a row to select it, `Enter` to open the details panel, and the double-click. **Order** is locked on now, the way **Description** already was - it is the grid's row header and the target of the two gestures that are not edits, not a field a tester chooses, and `ToolBarDefault.LOCKED_CHECKED` named it in its own text while the constant said otherwise. Fixed 9 September 2026, [#207](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/207) |
| **Difference 17** | The search read the description, the identity, the expected result and the steps, and knew nothing of the module, the group, the test data or the pre-conditions - each of which has its own column, and three of which have their own filter. It reads every field the tester writes now, the reference included (Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-091). Fixed 9 September 2026, [#212](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/212) |

## Not decided

**Question 1** — Should **Start Manual Execution** walk the whole test run or
the filtered list? It walks the filtered list today, and finishing it completes
the whole test run. Either the walk should ignore the filter, or completing
should only count what was walked.

**Question 2** — Should a verdict be recordable on a completed or closed test
run? The keyboard allows it, the automation refuses it, and the tooltip says it
is refused.

**Question 3** — Should a test case that already has a verdict be offered again
by the walk? It is offered today, and judging it again re-stamps who and when.

**Question 4** — Four groups can be filtered on and never assigned. Either the
create dialog should offer them or the filter should not.
