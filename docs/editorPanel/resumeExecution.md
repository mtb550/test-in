# UC-EDITOR-PANEL-036: Resume a test run I stopped

**As a** tester, **I want** to pick a test run up where I left it, **so that** a morning's work is not repeated after
lunch.

There is no separate resume button. Starting again is resuming, because the walk
always begins at the first test case with no run item status.

There is no key for this. Press **Start Manual Execution** again.

## Rules

- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-001** — A test set opens in one editor and a test run in
  another. Both are the same shape: a toolbar on top, the rows in the middle, a
  status bar at the bottom.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-002** — Both editors open showing cards. The grid is built
  the first time the tester asks for it.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-003** — A card is drawn to the width of the list. A title
  too long for that width wraps onto more lines, and the cards never scroll
  sideways.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-004** — A page holds 50 test cases until the tester says
  otherwise. The most a page can hold is 1000.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-005** — What the tester types is stored exactly. Testin
  may draw it differently, and never saves the drawn form.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-006** — A save that would leave the file as it is writes
  nothing, and says nothing.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-007** — Each editor keeps an undo history of its own, kept
  against the test set it is showing, and the tree keeps another.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-008** — Every change confirms itself with one message in
  the past tense. A change to several test cases gets one message with a count.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-009** — Moving the view says nothing and changes nothing.
  Paging, filtering, searching and opening the details panel are all silent.
  None of them throws a filter away: a test case the filter is hiding is
  reported rather than brought into view.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-010** — While a grid cell is open for editing, every key
  that would act on the row is refused.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-153** — Starting again finds the first test case with no
  run item status, so the walk resumes rather than restarting. A test case
  judged in the first sitting is passed over wherever it sits
  (Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-130).
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-154** — The clock adds to the time a test case already
  carried, rather than starting it again.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-155** — The stamp saying when execution began is kept.
  Only the stamp saying when it ended is written again.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-248** — A button that turns gray while the pointer is on
  it loses its hover look at once, so a control that has stopped working never
  looks ready to press.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-249** — A grid that held the keyboard when it was rebuilt
  holds it again afterward, so the next key lands in the grid rather than
  nowhere.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-250** — A grid row is drawn in its stripe, or in the
  selection color while it is selected, and in nothing else. The pointer passing
  over it changes nothing.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-251** — When the status bar is too narrow for everything,
  the figures on the right give way first, then the sentence on the left down to
  a short floor, and the page arrows keep their width to the last.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-252** — A badge's words are printed white or dark,
  whichever reads on its color, so a pale badge never carries white text.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-257** — An editor narrower than its toolbar or its status
  bar scrolls that bar sideways under the pointer, with the mouse wheel or a
  touchpad. No scrollbar is shown and the bar keeps its height, so nothing on it
  is cut off and the editor below does not move.

## What the tester sees

This opens no screen. It looks exactly like starting. The editor turns to the
first test case with no run item status, selects its row, and the clock starts
again.

Every test case judged in the first sitting keeps its run item status, and the
walk passes over it.

## Main flow

1. The tester stopped a walk after judging 20 of 80 test cases.
2. The tester comes back, opens the test run, and presses **Start Manual
   Execution**.
3. Testin finds test case 21, the first with no run item status.
4. The editor turns to the page holding it and selects it.
5. The clock starts again.

## What Testin refuses

**If the test run is completed or closed** — the button is gray, and its tooltip
says which status is stopping it. A test run signed off cannot be resumed.

**If every test case already has a run item status** — the walk reaches the end
at once, and the test run is marked completed.

## What is kept from before

| Kept                                   | Written again                              |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Every run item status already recorded | When execution ended                       |
| How long each test case took, added to | The run item statuses recorded from now on |
| When execution began                   |                                            |
