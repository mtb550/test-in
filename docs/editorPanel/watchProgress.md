# UC-EDITOR-PANEL-042: Watch how the test run is going

**As a** tester, **I want** to see how many have passed and how long I have
been at it, **so that** I can say when the test run will be finished.

The status bar reports. Nothing here changes a test case.

There is no key for this. The figures are in the status bar.

## Rules

- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-001** — A test set opens in one editor and a test run in
  another. Both are the same shape: a toolbar on top, the rows in the middle, a
  status bar at the bottom.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-002** — Both editors open showing cards. The grid is built
  the first time the tester asks for it.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-003** — A card is drawn to the width of the list. A title
  too long for that width wraps onto more lines, and the cards never scroll
  sideways.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-004** — A page holds 50 test cases until the tester says
  otherwise. The most a page can hold is 1000.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-005** — What the tester types is stored exactly. Testin
  may draw it differently, and never saves the drawn form.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-006** — A save that would leave the file as it is writes
  nothing, and says nothing.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-007** — Each editor keeps an undo history of its own, kept
  against the test set it is showing, and the tree keeps another.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-008** — Every change confirms itself with one message in
  the past tense. A change to several test cases gets one message with a count.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-009** — Moving the view says nothing and changes nothing.
  Paging, filtering, searching and opening the details panel are all silent.
  None of them throws a filter away: a test case the filter is hiding is
  reported rather than brought into view.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-010** — While a grid cell is open for editing, every key
  that would act on the row is refused.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-175** — A run item status no test case carries is not
  drawn at all.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-176** — The untouched test cases read **Pending** while
  the test run is open, and **Untested** once it is signed off.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-177** — The figures are worked out from what the test run
  holds now, not from disk.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-178** — A test run that has measured nothing shows a blank
  clock, not a row of zeros.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-179** — The three test run labels are hidden, not blank,
  when there is nothing to say. A test case editor never shows them.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-248** — A button that turns gray while the pointer is on
  it loses its hover look at once, so a control that has stopped working never
  looks ready to press.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-249** — A grid that held the keyboard when it was rebuilt
  holds it again afterward, so the next key lands in the grid rather than
  nowhere.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-250** — A grid row is drawn in its stripe, or in the
  selection color while it is selected, and in nothing else. The pointer passing
  over it changes nothing.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-251** — When the status bar is too narrow for everything,
  the figures on the right give way first, then the sentence on the left down to
  a short floor, and the page arrows keep their width to the last.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-252** — A badge's words are printed white or dark,
  whichever reads on its color, so a pale badge never carries white text.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-257** — An editor narrower than its toolbar or its status
  bar scrolls that bar sideways under the pointer, with the mouse wheel or a
  touchpad. No scrollbar is shown and the bar keeps its height, so nothing on it
  is cut off and the editor below does not move.
- **Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-265** — The test run status in the status bar is its icon
  alone, with the status named when the pointer rests on it. Beside the icon it
  shows the tester an Assigned test run is assigned to, and the commit a
  Committed test run was recorded in; any other status shows the icon only.

## The screen

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  4 of 12 test cases   |< < 1 of 1 > >|   In Progress                       │
│                       Passed 6 · Failed 2 · Pending 4     00:14:22  [ 50 ] │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **The test run status** — the same icon the tree draws, alone. Its tooltip
   names the status: *Completed. A committed test run records no more run item
   statuses*. Beside the icon: the tester's name when the test run is
   **Assigned**, the short commit id when it is **Committed**, nothing otherwise
   (Rule-EDITOR-PANEL-265).
2. **The figures** — one for each run item status any test case carries, each
   in that run item status's own color, separated by a dot. Their tooltip reads
   *How this test run is going*.
3. **The clock** — how long this test run has been executing. It ticks once a
   second while a test case is being timed. Its tooltip reads *Time spent
   executing this test run*.
4. **The page size** — how many test cases a page holds.

## Main flow

1. The tester starts executing.
2. The status becomes **In Progress**, and the clock starts.
3. Each run item status recorded moves one figure up and another down.
4. A run item status nobody has recorded yet is not drawn.
5. When the walk finishes, the status becomes **Completed** and the clock stops.

## What Testin refuses

Nothing. The status bar only reports.
