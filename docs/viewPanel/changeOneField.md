# UC-VIEW-PANEL-011: Change one field without leaving the panel

**As a** tester, **I want** to correct a field I have just noticed is wrong,
**so that** I do not have to go back to the editor and find the test case
again.

One field, one small dialog. The rest of the test case is left alone.

`F2` opens the menu of fields.

## Rules

- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-001** — The panel is docked on the right of the IDE, and a
  tester can tell it from the tree panel at a glance.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-002** — The panel shows one test case at a time.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-003** — The panel never opens on its own. The tester asks
  for a test case's details, and it opens.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-004** — Once open, the panel follows the tester. Once
  closed, it stays closed until the tester asks again.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-005** — Every value is read again from Testin's memory each
  time the panel draws. The panel cannot show a value that was changed somewhere
  else.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-006** — A field with nothing in it is not drawn. Its caption
  goes with it, so the panel is never a column of empty rows.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-007** — Opening, paging and closing say nothing. There is no
  message for any of them.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-008** — The panel has three tabs, and all three are drawn
  every time it refreshes.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-009** — Closing a Testin editor empties the panel when the
  panel is showing one of that editor's test cases, and leaves it alone
  otherwise.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-044** — `F2` works only once a test case has been drawn. It
  does nothing while the panel is empty.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-045** — The panel always changes exactly one test case,
  because it only ever shows one.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-046** — An edit Testin can find no test set to write to is
  refused, and says so. That happens to a test case opened from a search result,
  which arrives without its test set.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-047** — A save that would leave the file as it is writes
  nothing, and raises no message.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-048** — A saved change is one entry on the undo history.
- **Rule-VIEW-PANEL-049** — Saving a change rewrites the automation code for
  that field, where the field has any.

```

1. **Each row** — the field's name, then the letter that opens it.
2. **The first row** — selected when the menu opens.

Choosing a row opens that field's own small dialog. Those dialogs belong to the
editor panel. They are drawn on
[UC-EDITOR-PANEL-007](../editorPanel/changeOneField.md).

## Main flow

1. The panel is showing a test case, and the keyboard is in the panel.
2. The tester presses `F2`.
3. The **Update Test Case** menu opens, one row for each field.
4. The tester presses the field's letter, or picks the row.
5. That field's dialog opens with the current value in it.
6. The tester types and presses `Enter`.
7. Testin writes the test case and shows *Updated*.
8. The panel redraws with the new value.

## What Testin refuses

**If the panel is showing no test case** — `F2` does nothing.

**If the panel has never drawn a test case** — `F2` does nothing at all. The key
starts working the first time a test case is drawn.

**If the save would change nothing** — nothing is written, no message is raised,
and nothing goes on the undo history.

## Where the plugin breaks its own rules

**`Escape` cannot close the panel afterwards.** Using `F2` needs the keyboard to
be in the panel, and `Escape` does nothing there. That is difference 2.
