# UC-CODEGEN-006: Go to the code from a test case

**As a** tester, **I want** to open the method behind the test case I am looking
at, **so that** I can read or change what the automation really does.

This opens the Java method that runs the selected test case.

`Shift+F5` on the selected test case.

## Rules

- **Rule-CODEGEN-001** — A method is found by the identity in `testName`, never
  by its name. Renaming a test case never loses its method.
- **Rule-CODEGEN-002** — A test case with no description gets no method. A
  description is what names a method.
- **Rule-CODEGEN-003** — Testin writes only the method's annotation and its
  declaration. The body is the tester's, and Testin never touches it.
- **Rule-CODEGEN-004** — A rename or a move happens before the tree changes,
  while the old name still finds the code.
- **Rule-CODEGEN-005** — Test management works without any of this. A missing
  Java plugin or a missing test folder is a skip, never a failure.
- **Rule-CODEGEN-006** — What goes wrong while writing code goes to the log. The
  tester is not shown it.
- **Rule-CODEGEN-082** — Testin touches a test project's automation code only
  when `testin.yml` names that test project. Otherwise nothing is generated,
  renamed, moved or removed, **Automate Test Case**, **Navigate to Code** and
  **Run Tests** are gray and say why, and no gutter icon or automated mark is
  shown. **Save to testin.yml**, in the Testin panel, turns code on.
- **Rule-CODEGEN-026** — The method is found by the identity in `testName`, so a
  test case that has been renamed still finds its method.
- **Rule-CODEGEN-027** — Without the Java plugin the card and the view panel
  draw no class button, and the menu entry stays, grayed, reading *(needs the
  Java plugin)*.

## The three ways in

| The tester does this | Where |
|---|---|
| Presses `Shift+F5` | The list of test cases in either editor |
| Chooses **Navigate to Code** | The menu in either editor |
| Clicks the class button | A card under the pointer, or the view panel |

## The screen

The Java file opens in the IDE's own editor, and the caret lands on the method
that runs this test case.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     40      @Test(description = "Log in with a valid user",              │
│     41            testName = "3f2a05c1-8b44-4e2a-9f31-0c7d6b1a9c1b",     │
│     42            priority = 3)                                          │
│     43      public void |logInWithAValidUser() {                         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **The caret** — drawn here as `|`. It lands on the method, not at the top of
   the file.
2. **The line numbers** — the file is scrolled to the method, so a long class
   does not have to be searched.

## Main flow

1. The tester selects a test case and presses `Shift+F5`.
2. Testin works out the class from the test case's place in the tree.
3. Testin finds the method carrying that test case's identity.
4. The Java file opens with the caret on that method.

## What Testin refuses

**If the test case has no method** — nothing opens, and Testin says *\<test
case\> has no generated code yet*, the same sentence **Run Tests** gives.

**If the IDE is still indexing** — a message reads **Waiting for indexing**, and
the jump happens when indexing finishes.

**If the class cannot be found** — nothing opens, and only the log says so.

**If the IDE has no Java plugin** — the menu entry is still there, grayed,
reading *(needs the Java plugin)*, and the class button is not drawn. If it is
reached anyway, a message titled **Java Plugin Not Available** appears. It
appears every time, not once.

**If testin.yml does not name the open test project** - the menu entry is
still there, grayed, and says *testin.yml does not name this test project. Save to testin.yml, in the Testin panel, turns code on.* The card's icon is gray and
says the same, and pressing it says it (Rule-CODEGEN-082).
