# Automation code and the gutter

Testin writes a Java test method for every test case, and keeps it in step as
the tree changes. The marks in the gutter beside those methods lead back to the
test case they came from.

## What this part is for

A test case says what to do. A test method does it. Keeping the two in step by
hand is the work that makes teams give up on automation: a test case is renamed
and the method keeps the old name, a test case is removed and the method stays
forever.

So Testin writes the method, and rewrites it whenever the tree changes. The
tester never edits the parts Testin owns.

**Four words, before the rules use them.**

- The **test source folder** is the folder in the code project marked as holding
  Java tests. Testin writes everything under it.
- A **generated method** is the Java method Testin wrote for one test case.
- The **gutter** is the narrow strip down the left of a code editor, where the
  IDE draws its own marks.
- To be **in step** is for the code to say what the tree says. Testin's job here
  is keeping it that way.

---

## What Testin writes

For a test case, one method:

```java
@Test(description = "Log in with a valid user",
      testName = "3f2a05c1-8b44-4e2a-9f31-0c7d6b1a9c1b",
      groups = {"REGRESSION", "SMOKE"},
      priority = 3)
public void logInWithAValidUser() {
    // TODO: Auto-generated test steps for logInWithAValidUser
}
```

1. **description** — the test case's description, exactly.
2. **testName** — the test case's identity. This is what ties the method to the
   test case, and it is the only part that must never be edited.
3. **groups** — the test case's groups. Written only when it has any.
4. **priority** — the test case's **position in its test set**, counting from
   one. It is the method's priority, which is what TestNG runs methods in the
   order of. The test case's own High, Medium or Low is a different thing and
   writes nothing here (Rule-CODEGEN-014).
5. **The method name** — the description with everything but letters and digits
   removed, the first word lowercase and later words capitalized.
6. **The body** — one comment, and nothing else. The tester writes the rest.

For a test set, one class holding those methods. For a package, a folder.

## Every key

| Key | What it does | The page that owns it |
|---|---|---|
| `Shift+F5` | Goes to the generated method | [UC-CODEGEN-006](goToCode.md) |
| `F5` | Runs the selected test cases, or stops them | [UC-CODEGEN-008](runAutomation.md) |
| `F12` | **Automate Test Case**, which is not built | [UC-CODEGEN-005](automateTestCase.md) |

The gutter mark has no key. Stopping has no key of its own.

## Where the code lands

```
testin_example/
└── src/test/java/                     the test source folder
    └── demo/                          the test project
        └── accounts/                  a test set package
            └── LoginTest.java         a test set
                logInWithAValidUser()  a test case
```

1. **The test source folder** — found once per code project, and remembered.
2. **Each folder above the test set** — becomes a package.
3. **The test set** — becomes a class, whose name always ends in `Test`.
4. **Each test case** — becomes a method in that class.

The two fixed folders, test run packages and test runs generate nothing at all.

A package is never written on its own. The folders are made on the way to a
class, so creating a package and stopping there puts nothing on disk, and the
folder appears when the first test set is created inside it. Java has no empty
packages, and an empty folder is invisible to the thing that looks a class up
by name.

## When Testin will not generate

Writing code touches two things the plugin does not own: the IDE's Java support,
and the IDE's index.

**Without the Java plugin**, nothing is generated at all. A message says so once
for the whole code project, and every later operation is a silent skip. That is
[UC-CODEGEN-021](noJavaPlugin.md).

**While the IDE is indexing**, Testin refuses and says so. Every generated file
is found by the name of the class it belongs to, and looking a class up by name
is a question the index answers - so until the index is built there is no answer
to give.

The refusal is deliberate, rather than waiting for the index and doing the work
afterwards. Waiting would be right for creating something and wrong for renaming
or moving it: **Rule-CODEGEN-004** has a rename happen while the old name still
finds the code, and a rename that waited would run after the tree had changed
and look for a class that no longer answers to that name. So Testin says it
cannot, and the tester's next attempt works.

Both answers are given in one place, so a fifteenth operation gets them without
asking. Everything Testin writes runs inside one of the IDE's write commands,
which is also what makes each operation a single entry on the undo history.

## Where the plugin breaks its own rules

Stated, not hidden. Each one is real and can be met today. None of them has a
bug report yet.

| | The rule it breaks | What a tester sees |
|---|---|---|
| **Difference 3** | Rule-CODEGEN-001 — one test case, one method | Two test cases whose descriptions differ only in punctuation share one method, and the second gets none. It can no longer be typed: the create dialog and the update dialog both refuse such a description and say which method it would have named. It can still arrive by the doors that cannot refuse — an import, a paste, a Git merge, a sync, and the bulk description editor — and a test set that already held a clash before the refusal existed still holds it. Those no longer pass in silence: generating says which test cases got no method and why, so the tester learns it then rather than at the first `F5`. |
| **Difference 6** | Rule-CODEGEN-004 — the tree and the code agree | Moving a test set to a place Testin has not read still leaves the class where it was — guessing a destination the tree has not read is what once moved a whole package into the default package and lost it. The tester is told now, in a notification that stays, naming the class and what to do about it. The tree and the code disagree until they act. |
| **Difference 7** | Rule-CODEGEN-005 — a missing plugin is a skip | Fixed. **Run Test Case** declares both plugins it needs — TestNG starts the run, Java finds the method it starts — so it is gray in an IDE with only one of them, reading *(needs the Java plugin)*. The three entries are also shown in every IDE now rather than left out, which reverses what difference 66 decided: a menu that changes shape between IDEs teaches a tester nothing. |
| **Difference 9** | Rule-CODEGEN-011 — one name for one thing | Fixed, and the row cited the wrong rule: Rule-CODEGEN-003 is about the method body. Two test sets whose names come to nothing are named after what they were called, so they no longer share `DefaultTest` — and the package fallback no longer carries a timestamp, so a node names the same package on the call that writes its code and the call that comes looking for it. |

**Settled since this list was written.** The numbers are left out rather than
closed up, so an issue that quotes one still points at the right thing.

| Gone | Was |
|---|---|
| **Difference 2** | **Automate Test Case** and `F12` were live on every selected test case and always answered *Not built yet*, so the one entry named after generating code was the one that did not. It is gray now and its own name says why - *Automate Test Case (not built yet)* - which is what the no-hidden-buttons rule asks for. The feature behind it is still [#3](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/3). Fixed 10 September 2026, [#243](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/243) |
| **Difference 5** | One state said two ways: *has no generated code yet* when run, **Nothing to open** when jumped to. Both go through the one owner now. Fixed 9 September 2026, [#246](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/246) |
| **Difference 1** | `priority` in the generated method carries the position, not the test case's priority. Not a difference: a test method's priority and a test case's priority are different things, and the case's own writes nothing into the code on purpose. Decided 7 September 2026, [#242](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/242) |
| **Difference 8** | A removal, a move and a rename all read *Class Name Unknown* from the one place that builds a class name, because only creating one made that news. It goes to the log now, which is what Rule-CODEGEN-006 said all along. Fixed 9 September 2026, [#249](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/249) |
| **Difference 4** | Clicking the gutter mark of a removed test case did nothing at all, and generated code outlives its test case, so that was the ordinary case rather than a rare one. It says so now, naming the method (Rule-CODEGEN-069). Rule-CODEGEN-006 is not what it broke: that rule is about what goes wrong while Testin writes code, and this is a tester's click getting no answer. Fixed 9 September 2026, [#245](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/245) |

## Not decided

**Question 1** — Should `priority` in the generated method carry the position or
the test case's priority? It carries the position on purpose, so a test run
executes in the tester's order. The attribute's name says otherwise.

**Question 2** — Should a test case whose method was skipped for a name clash be
told so at the moment it is created? Today the tester finds out at the first
`F5`.

**Question 3** — The gutter mark is drawn only for TestNG methods Testin wrote.
A tester who edits the identity loses the mark with nothing saying why.
