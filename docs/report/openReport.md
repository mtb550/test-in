# UC-REPORT-002: Open the report that was just made

**As a** tester, **I want** to see the document straight away,
**so that** I can check it before sending it, without hunting through a folder.

This opens the report Testin has just written, from the message about it.

There is no key for this. The link is on the message.

## Rules

- **Rule-REPORT-001** — A report is about exactly one test run.
- **Rule-REPORT-002** — Every format reads the same figures, so two reports on
  one test run cannot disagree.
- **Rule-REPORT-003** — A report is written after the dialog closes, under a
  progress bar the tester can cancel. Stopping it leaves no file behind: the
  report is written in one go at the end.
- **Rule-REPORT-004** — A report is written where the tester chose. It never
  lands under the Testin folder.
- **Rule-REPORT-005** — The project named in a report is the test project, not
  the code project the IDE has open.
- **Rule-REPORT-010** — The link is on the message that says the report was
  written, and the message stays in the IDE's notification list.
- **Rule-REPORT-011** — Clicking the link makes the message go.
- **Rule-REPORT-012** — The file is handed to whatever application on this
  machine claims it.

## The screen

There is no dialog. The whole of this use case is one link on the message
Testin shows when a report has been written.

```

1. **The title** — the format in capital letters, then *Report Generated*.
2. **The line under it** — *Saved successfully:*, then the file name.
3. **Open report** — this use case. Clicking it opens the file.
4. **Copy path** — puts the whole path on the clipboard. That is
   [UC-REPORT-003](copyReportPath.md).
5. **The message** — it waits in the IDE's notification list. It does not fade.

## Main flow

1. Testin writes the report and shows the message.
2. The tester clicks **Open report**.
3. The message goes.
4. The computer opens the file. It uses the program that owns that kind of
   file, such as a PDF reader for a PDF.

## What Testin refuses

**If the file is no longer there** — a message titled **Open Error** reads *The
file does not exist.*

**If this machine cannot open files that way** — a message titled **System
Error** reads *Opening a file is not supported on this system.*

**If the open fails** — a message titled **Execution Error** reads *Failed to
open the file:* and then the reason.

**If the report is a web page** — it opens in the browser, which is where a web
page is read. That holds whether the file was made as a report or as an export:
one kind of file, one answer.
