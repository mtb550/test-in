# UC-INTERNAL-002: Read a test project from disk

**As a** tester, **I want** Testin to read my test projects into memory before
it draws anything, **so that** every panel answers at once instead of going to
disk for each row.

This is the loading step. It is why the tree opens at once.

There is no key for this. It starts on its own.

## Rules

- **Rule-INTERNAL-003** — A folder is a test project only if it holds a file
  named `.tp`.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-004** — Only the folders directly inside the Testin folder are
  looked at. A test project one level deeper is not found.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-005** — A test project that is not **Active** is read,
  and nothing inside it is.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-006** — When a test project is named for this code project -
  by `testin.yml`, or chosen on this machine - only that one is read.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-007** — Inside a test project, Testin reads two folders. They
  are named `Test Cases` and `Test Runs`. Nothing else is read.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-008** — A folder inside `Test Cases` is read only if it holds
  a file named `.ts` or a file named `.tsp`. The first makes it a test set. The
  second makes it a test set package.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-009** — A folder holding both is read as a test set.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-010** — A folder inside `Test Runs` is read the same way, from
  a file named `.tr` or a file named `.trp`.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-011** — A file's name says what it is: every file ending in
  `.tc` directly inside a test set is a test case, and every file ending in `.ri`
  directly inside a test run is one case's result. Nothing looks inside a file to
  decide what it is.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-012** — A test case is known by its file name. What the file
  says its own name is does not decide.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-013** — Each test project is read by its own background job.
  The tester can cancel it, and the IDE stays usable while it runs.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-014** — One thing that cannot be read never stops the rest.
  Testin skips it and carries on, and says which ones it could not read. A node
  whose marker will not parse is still drawn, and the scan names it.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-015** — A folder skipped for having no marker is reported when
  it holds test cases. A folder holding none is skipped in silence, because a
  folder that is deliberately not a test set is the ordinary case.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-062** — Reading a test case costs no more than 40 microseconds
  and holds no more than 4 kilobytes. Ten thousand test cases is the size the
  budget is stated at.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-070** — A timestamp is stored in the zone it happened in, on
  every machine. Testin never converts one into the zone of whoever is reading,
  so the same test case is the same bytes wherever it is saved and a colleague
  elsewhere does not rewrite a file by opening it.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-082** — Two test case files claiming one identity are reported
  rather than merged. A test case is identified by its file name, and the index
  holds one case per identity, so the second file read goes over the first and
  neither test set can reach its own any more. The read cannot choose which of
  the pair keeps the identity, so it names the files and leaves that to the
  tester.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-083** — Who created a node, and when, is stamped once: the
  first time its marker is written. After that the creation stays as it was,
  even while no tester name is set. A marker file that is there but will not
  parse is never written over, so it is still there to repair.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-089** — `testin.yml` is read and written by one class, and
  written only when the tester presses **Save to testin.yml**
  (Rule-TREE-PANEL-112). Testin never needs it: when a code project has none, or
  it leaves a value out, nothing refuses, stalls or asks the tester to create it;
  only the automation code stays off (Rule-CODEGEN-082). When it is there, what
  it says is read in one place, so a missing value means the same thing
  everywhere.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-090** — Every folder carries an id of its own in its marker:
  stamped the first time Testin writes that marker, never changed afterwards,
  and fresh on a copied folder. Nothing in Testin reads it; it names a project,
  a set or a run for a tool outside the IDE.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-093** — A result file Testin could not read is never written
  over and never removed. The scan reports it and leaves it out of the run, so
  the run covers the cases it could read; a later write touches only the results
  the run holds, and a removal takes only the file whose case a change stopped
  covering. A verdict nobody can read is still a verdict somebody recorded, and
  the tester repairs the file and presses Refresh.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-094** — A result is known by its file name, as a test case is.
  A result file whose name is not a test case id is not read, and a warning
  names it; renamed to its test case's id, it is read again at the next Refresh.
  Nothing writes a second file for it.

## The budget

A test project of ten thousand test cases, and the results of its test runs,
measured rather than estimated.

| | Measured | Budget |
|---|---|---|
| **Reading one test case** | 21 µs | 40 µs |
| **Reading ten thousand** | 214 ms | 400 ms |
| **Held in memory, per case** | 1.5 KB | 4 KB |
| **Held in memory, ten thousand** | 14.6 MB | 40 MB |
| **Reading one run result** | 8.8 µs | 20 µs |
| **Reading four thousand** | 35 ms | 80 ms |

The results are their own line because they are their own files: since #305 a run
of two thousand cases is two thousand `.ri` files rather than one `run.json`, so
the question "what does a big cycle cost to read" is a question about four
thousand small documents - one cycle of two thousand cases and fifty of forty,
which is the shape of a real Testin folder. Two thousand of them parse in about
18 milliseconds.

Measured on 9 September 2026 (the cases) and 20 September 2026 (the results),
Windows 11 with JBR 25, by `IndexerBudgetTest`. CI asserts the budget on every push, on a runner doing
nothing else, so a change that doubles the cost fails rather than ships. It is
its own run - `./gradlew test -Pbudget` - and not part of the ordinary one,
because a clock on a machine that is also compiling measures the machine.

**What the budget covers is the reading, not the disk.** The same ten thousand
cases written out as files and walked took **3.5 seconds warm and 150 seconds
cold** on the same machine — a forty-fold spread on identical work, because a
cold read of ten thousand freshly written files is the virus scanner's number
rather than the plugin's. Those two figures are measured and reported by the
same test with `-Dtestin.budget.cases=10000`, and deliberately not asserted on:
a budget that fails on a loaded runner and passes through a real regression on a
fast disk is worse than none.

So the honest statement is two sentences. The part Testin controls is 214
milliseconds for ten thousand cases. The part the machine controls is
everything else, and it is why the scan runs in the background with a progress
bar the tester can cancel (Rule-INTERNAL-013).

## What starts a read

| The tester does this | What Testin reads |
|---|---|
| Opens a code project that has a Testin folder set | Every test project |
| Presses **Refresh** on the panel toolbar | Every test project, from nothing |
| Changes a file outside the IDE | The one test project that holds it, see [UC-INTERNAL-003](noticeOutsideChange.md) |
| Finishes a sync with Git | The one test project that was synced |
| Switches branch | The one test project in that repository |
| Clones a test project | The one that was cloned |

## The screen

Testin shows one progress bar for each test project it is reading. It sits at
the bottom of the IDE, beside the other background jobs.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Testin indexing - Checkout                            [ X ] │
│  ████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  40% │
│  Test set: Payment (12 cases)                                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **The title** — always *Testin indexing*, then the test project's name.
2. **The cancel button** — stops this test project. What was read is kept.
3. **The line underneath** — the test set or test run being read right now.

## Main flow

1. The tester opens a code project, or presses **Refresh**.
2. Testin reads the Testin folder from the settings.
3. Testin lists the folders directly inside it, and keeps those holding a `.tp`
   file.
4. Testin starts one background job for each of them.
5. The bar reads *Indexing*, then the test project's name.
6. The bar reads the test project's name, then *test sets...*.
7. Testin walks `Test Cases`. For each test set, it reads every `.tc` file
   at the same time. It does not read them one after another.
8. After each test set the bar reads *Test set:*, then its name, then how many
   test cases it holds.
9. The bar reads the test project's name, then *test runs...*.
10. Testin walks `Test Runs`. Each test run reads its own facts from its `.tr`
    - its status, how it was configured, what the tester wrote about the
    verdicts, when it was executed - and one file per result, `<test case
    id>.ri`, in the order their cases sit in their test sets.
11. The bar reads *Done -*, then the test project's name, and closes.
12. The tree draws itself from memory. Every editor that was open when the IDE
    closed opens again.

## What Testin refuses

**If no Testin folder is set** — nothing is read, and nothing is said. The panel
shows its empty state instead.

**If a folder under the Testin folder holds no `.tp` file** — it is not a test
project, and it is skipped without a word. This is the ordinary case. The
Testin folder usually holds other things.

**If the `.tp` file cannot be read** — the tester gets a notification titled
**Read Test Project Failed**, reading *Skipping invalid format:* and the file
name. That whole test project is left out.

**If a `.ts`, `.tsp`, `.tr` or `.trp` file cannot be read** — the same
notification, titled for that kind of node. The message reads *Failed to parse
directory:* and the file name.

**If a marker file is missing** — nothing is said. A node just created has no
marker yet, so Testin uses defaults and the node appears normally.

**If a marker file is there but damaged** — the node still appears, with default
values, and once the read has finished one message names every node whose
marker would not parse. Testin never writes over that file, whatever writes it:
a test case saved into the test set, and a test run's status changed from the
tree, both leave the marker exactly as it is. So the number, the status, who
made it, how the run was configured and what the tester wrote about the verdicts
are all still there to repair (Rule-INTERNAL-083).

**If a folder under `Test Cases` holds no `.ts` and no `.tsp` file** — the
folder is skipped. Everything inside it is skipped too. When it holds test
cases, Testin says so once the read has finished. One message names all such
folders. That message waits in the notification list instead of fading, because
a read finishes on its own time and the tester may be looking elsewhere.

**If such a folder holds no test cases** — it is skipped without a word. Most
folders that are not test sets are nothing, and reporting each one would be
noise.

**If one test case file cannot be read** — that one test case is left out of its
test set. The others are read. The set is drawn one row shorter, and nothing
says which row is missing.

**If one result file cannot be read** — the run is drawn without that result,
and once the read has finished one message names all of them. It is titled
**Results not read in \<project\>** and it says the file names, up to five of
them, then how many more there are. Nothing writes over a result Testin cannot
read and nothing removes it, so the repair is to fix the file and press
**Refresh**.

**If two test case files claim the same identity** — the second one read goes
over the first, and a notification titled **Test cases sharing an identity in
\<project\>** names the files. Neither test set can reach its own case while that
is true: both resolve the identity to whichever file landed last, so an edit in
one showed in the other. The file name is the identity, so the repair is to
rename one of them - which of the two keeps it is the tester's to decide, not
the plugin's.

**If the tester presses cancel** — the read stops between one test set and the
next. What was already read stays in memory. The rest of that test project is
missing until the next **Refresh**.

**If the whole read fails** — Testin does not mark itself as read, and tries
again the next time something asks it to.
