# UC-INTERNAL-006: Count what a node holds

**As a** tester, **I want** the numbers on a node to be true at the moment I
read them, **so that** I can decide from them, especially in the dialog that
asks me to confirm a removal.

There is no key for this. The counts are worked out when a screen that shows
them opens.

## Rules

- **Rule-INTERNAL-046** — A count is worked out when it is asked for, and stored
  nowhere. A number that is never saved cannot be stale.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-047** — A container is the sum of everything beneath it, at
  any depth.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-048** — A test run is counted from the verdicts it recorded,
  not from the test cases it was made from.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-049** — A test run's numbers come from one place, so its
  Details and its report can never disagree.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-050** — Retired test sets and archived packages are counted.
  That a branch is out of current work is already visible in the tree, which
  draws it gray and sorts it last.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-051** — A test run that could not be read counts as nothing,
  rather than failing. The tree already draws the node, so its Details still
  says what the node is.
- **Rule-INTERNAL-052** — A test run nobody has judged shows *Not run*, never
  *0%*.

## Where the counts appear

| Screen | What it shows |
|---|---|
| The Details popup on a tree node | A row for each count, and a ring for a test run. Drawn on [UC-TREE-PANEL-027](../treePanel/nodeDetails.md) |
| The removal confirmation | One line saying what goes with the node. Drawn on [UC-TREE-PANEL-012](../treePanel/removeNode.md) |

## What each node counts

| The node | The counts it shows |
|---|---|
| A test project | Test sets, Packages, Test cases, Test runs |
| **Test Cases** | Test sets, Packages, Test cases |
| **Test Runs** | Packages, Test runs |
| A test set package | Test sets, Packages, Test cases |
| A test run package | Packages, Test runs |
| A test set | Test cases |
| A test run | Total, and a ring of its verdicts |

The verdicts on the ring are **Passed**, **Failed**, **Blocked**, **Untested**
and **Removed**. The pass rate sits in the middle of it.

## Main flow

1. The tester opens Details on a node, or presses `Delete` on it.
2. Testin walks everything beneath that node, in memory.
3. Testin groups what it finds by kind, and adds up each kind.
4. Test cases are counted from how many the test set holds, not by sorting them.
   Sorting 2,770 test cases to produce a number nobody reads is work for
   nothing.
5. A test run is not walked. Its recorded verdicts are added up instead.
6. The screen draws the rows. The removal confirmation draws one line, reading
   *Holds*, then the test sets, the test cases and the test runs.
7. Nothing is saved. The next screen that asks counts again.

## What Testin refuses

**If the node holds nothing** — the removal confirmation shows no *Holds* line
at all, rather than a line of zeros.

**If a test run has no verdicts yet** — the middle of the ring reads *Not run*.
A *0%* there would read as every test case having failed.

**If a test run cannot be read** — every count is zero and nothing fails. The
node is still in the tree, so Details still opens on it.

**If the branch holds retired test sets** — they are counted. A deprecated test
set still holds its test cases.

## Where the plugin breaks its own rules

**A count can be larger than what a test run will offer.** Details counts
retired test sets. Choosing test cases for a new test run leaves them out. So a
test project whose Details says 40 test cases can offer 31 when a test run is
made on it, and nothing explains the difference.

## Why it works this way

The counts used to be found by matching the start of each path against the
node's own path. A node's path starts with itself. So removing a test set
holding 12 test cases read *Holds 1 test set, 12 test cases and 0 test runs*,
and removing a test run said it held one test run. That was in the one dialog
whose whole job is to say what an unrecoverable removal takes with it.
