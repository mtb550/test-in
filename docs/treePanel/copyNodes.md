# UC-TREE-PANEL-014: Copy nodes

> **`Ctrl+C`** copies and **`Ctrl+V`** pastes. Dragging with `Ctrl` held copies
> too. On the menu: **Actions → Copy** and **Paste**.

**As a** tester, **I want** to copy a node into another folder, **so that** I
can start from something that already exists instead of writing it again.

The copy is new and separate. Changing it never changes the original.

## Rules

- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-001** — The panel shows exactly one test project. It is the
  one this repository is bound to. There is no list of test projects in the
  tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-002** — **Test Cases** and **Test Runs** are fixed
  containers. They cannot be created, renamed, moved, copied or removed. They
  come with the test project and go with it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-003** — The tree has two sides, and nothing moves between
  them. Test sets and test set packages live under **Test Cases**. Test runs and
  test run packages live under **Test Runs**.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-004** — Two nodes under one parent cannot share a name. This
  holds whether the node is created, renamed, pasted or dropped.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-005** — A node name is never empty.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-006** — Removing, moving or copying asks first. Nothing in
  the tree changes until the tester confirms.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-007** — When something changes, Testin says so once, in the
  past tense. The tester sees *Created*, *Renamed* or *Removed*. Several changes
  at once confirm once, with a count: the tester sees *Removed 4*, never four
  messages. Looking at something confirms nothing.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-008** — A retired node keeps everything inside it. Retired
  means a **Deprecated** test set or an **Archived** package. It is drawn gray.
  It sorts after live nodes. It is not offered when a test run is created.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-009** — A test run that is **Completed** or **Closed** is
  signed off. Its test cases, verdicts and configuration can no longer change.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-010** — Siblings are shown in one order:
  1. live nodes, then retired ones
  2. the number the tester gave the node
  3. the date the node was created
  4. the name
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-011** — A removed node goes to the desktop's recycle bin. It
  can be put back from the tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-012** — A test case is not a node in this tree. It is
  reached by opening its test set.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-013** — Nodes move only within one test project. Nothing cut
  in one test project can be pasted into another.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-051** — A copied test case is a new test case, with its own
  id. Editing the copy never changes the original.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-052** — A copy cannot be undone. To take one back, remove
  it, which is [UC-TREE-PANEL-012](removeNode.md).
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-053** — A copy carries everything the original had beside
  its test cases: its order number, and its **Deprecated** or **Archived**
  status. A copy of a retired test set is retired too. A copied test run keeps
  the results the original recorded.

Rule-TREE-PANEL-043, Rule-TREE-PANEL-044, Rule-TREE-PANEL-045 and
Rule-TREE-PANEL-049 hold here too. They say where a node can land, and they are
on [UC-TREE-PANEL-013](moveNodes.md).

## What the tester sees

Nothing in the tree changes when the tester copies. The nodes stay black, and
*Copied* shows above the status bar at the bottom right of the IDE. Pasting then
opens the dialog drawn under [UC-TREE-PANEL-013](moveNodes.md). Its title reads
**Paste**, and it asks *Copy N items into '\<folder\>'?*.

## Main flow

1. The tester selects one or more test sets, packages or test runs.
2. The tester presses `Ctrl+C`, or chooses **Actions → Copy**. Nothing in the
   tree changes, and Testin shows *Copied*, or *Copied N* for several.
3. The tester selects a folder that can hold them.
4. The tester presses `Ctrl+V`, or chooses **Actions → Paste**.
5. The **Paste** dialog asks what will be copied, and where to.
6. The tester presses `Enter`. The nodes are duplicated, and Testin shows
   *Pasted*, or *Pasted N*.
7. Every test case in the copy gets its own id, and the copy is selected in the
   tree.

**By dragging.** The tester holds `Ctrl` while releasing a dragged node. The
dialog is then titled **Copy**, and `Enter` copies instead of moving.

## What Testin refuses

The same refusals as a move, and they are on
[UC-TREE-PANEL-013](moveNodes.md#what-testin-refuses).

**If the copy fails on disk** — an IDE notification titled *Copy Failed* stays
in the notification log, with the reason under it.

**If the Java plugin is installed** — new automation code is written for the
copy. Without the plugin, the copy has none. The first copy in the project then
says *Java Plugin Not Available*.
