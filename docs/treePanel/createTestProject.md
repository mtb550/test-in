# UC-TREE-PANEL-002: Create a test project

> **No key.** Press **New Test Project** at the top of the panel, or the
> welcome link **Create your first test project**.

**As a** tester, **I want** to create a test project by name, **so that** a new
product under test has a place before any test is written.

A test project is the folder that holds all the test work for one product.

## Rules

- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-001** — The panel shows exactly one test project. It is the
  one this repository is bound to. There is no list of test projects in the
  tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-002** — **Test Cases** and **Test Runs** are fixed
  containers. They cannot be created, renamed, moved, copied or removed. They
  come with the test project and go with it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-003** — The tree has two sides, and nothing moves between
  them. Test sets and test set packages live under **Test Cases**. Test runs and
  test run packages live under **Test Runs**.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-004** — Two nodes under one parent cannot share a name. This
  holds whether the node is created, renamed, pasted or dropped.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-005** — A node name is never empty.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-006** — Removing, moving or copying asks first. Nothing in
  the tree changes until the tester confirms.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-007** — When something changes, Testin says so once, in the
  past tense. The tester sees *Created*, *Renamed* or *Removed*. Several changes
  at once confirm once, with a count: the tester sees *Removed 4*, never four
  messages. Looking at something confirms nothing.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-008** — A retired node keeps everything inside it. Retired
  means a **Deprecated** test set or an **Archived** package. It is drawn gray.
  It sorts after live nodes. It is not offered when a test run is created.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-009** — A test run that is **Completed** or **Closed** is
  signed off. Its test cases, verdicts and configuration can no longer change.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-010** — Siblings are shown in one order:
  1. live nodes, then retired ones
  2. the number the tester gave the node
  3. the date the node was created
  4. the name
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-011** — A removed node goes to the desktop's recycle bin. It
  can be put back from the tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-012** — A test case is not a node in this tree. It is
  reached by opening its test set.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-013** — Nodes move only within one test project. Nothing cut
  in one test project can be pasted into another.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-099** — A node that is retired says which kind of retired it
  is. A deprecated test set, an archived package and a test run all draw their
  status in gray beside the name - a run always, because a cycle state is what
  the tree is read for, and everything else only when it is retired, so the word
  appears where it means something.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-016** — A test project is a folder directly under the Testin
  folder. Any other folder there is ignored.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-017** — Creating a test project binds this code project to
  it.

## The Create Project dialog

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Create Project                                              │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                              │
│  [tp]  set name or paste url...                         (1)  │
│                                                              │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Enter Confirm    Escape Cancel                         (2)  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **One field** — its gray hint text reads *set name or paste url...*. What the
   tester types decides what happens. A Git address is cloned, which is
   [UC-TREE-PANEL-003](importTestProject.md). Anything else is the name of a new
   test project. There is no list to pick from. A list would only ask the
   tester to repeat what they just typed.
2. **The status bar** — every key this dialog answers to.

The **New Test Project** button opens it. So does the welcome link **Create your
first test project**. That link is drawn under
[UC-TREE-PANEL-001](reachTheTree.md).

## Main flow

1. The tester presses the **New Test Project** button in the panel header, or
   the welcome link **Create your first test project**.
2. The tester types a name and presses `Enter`.
3. Testin creates the test project folder in the Testin folder.
4. Testin binds this code project to it, and the tree appears.
5. Testin shows *Project created*.

To copy a test project that already exists somewhere else, paste its address
instead of a name. That is [UC-TREE-PANEL-003](importTestProject.md).

## What Testin refuses

**If the name is empty** — the gray hint text turns red, and the dialog stays
open.

**If a folder with that name already exists in the Testin folder** — nothing is
created, and *\<name\> Already Exists* is shown in red.

**If the name cannot be a Java package** — the dialog stays open with the name
still in the box, and *'\<name\>' cannot name a Java package* is shown in red.
`New`, `Class` and `Import` are the usual ones: Java keeps those words for
itself. (Rule-TREE-PANEL-095) A repository address is never asked to be
one: the folder is named by `testin.yml` rather than by the URL.

**If no Testin folder is set** — the **New Test Project** button is gray.
