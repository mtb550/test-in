# UC-TREE-PANEL-011: Rename a node

> **`Shift+F6`**, with a test project, a test set, a package or a test run
> selected. On the menu: **Actions → Rename**.

**As a** tester, **I want** to rename a test project, a test set, a package or
a test run, **so that** the tree says what things are called now. A project
cloned under its repository's name can take the name the team uses.

This changes the name of one node. Nothing inside it moves.

## Rules

- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-001** — The panel shows exactly one test project. It is the
  one this repository is bound to. There is no list of test projects in the
  tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-002** — **Test Cases** and **Test Runs** are fixed
  containers. They cannot be created, renamed, moved, copied or removed. They
  come with the test project and go with it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-003** — The tree has two sides, and nothing moves between
  them. Test sets and test set packages live under **Test Cases**. Test runs and
  test run packages live under **Test Runs**.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-004** — Two nodes under one parent cannot share a name. This
  holds whether the node is created, renamed, pasted or dropped.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-005** — A node name is never empty.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-006** — Removing, moving or copying asks first. Nothing in
  the tree changes until the tester confirms.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-007** — When something changes, Testin says so once, in the
  past tense. The tester sees *Created*, *Renamed* or *Removed*. Several changes
  made together confirm with one message and a count: the tester sees *Removed 4*, never four messages. Looking at
  something confirms nothing.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-008** — A retired node keeps everything inside it. Retired
  means a **Deprecated** test set or an **Archived** package. It is drawn gray.
  It sorts after live nodes. It is not offered when a test run is created.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-009** — A test run that is **Completed** or **Closed** is
  signed off. Its test cases, verdicts and configuration can no longer change.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-010** — Siblings are shown in one order:
    1. live nodes, then retired ones
    2. the number the tester gave the node
    3. the date the node was created
    4. the name
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-011** — A removed node goes to the desktop's recycle bin. It
  can be put back from the tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-012** — A test case is not a node in this tree. It is
  reached by opening its test set.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-013** — Nodes move only within one test project. Nothing cut
  in one test project can be pasted into another.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-099** — A node says its status beside its name when the status
  is not active. An inactive test project, a deprecated test set and an archived
  package each say which they are, in gray; a node in current work says nothing,
  because "Active" on every name is a word read a hundred times and needed
  never. A test run always says its status, because where a cycle stands is what
  the tree is read for.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-036** — Renaming a test project, a test set or a test set
  package renames its automation code with it, so the test case stays runnable.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-037** — A rename can be undone.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-100** — A test project that is not active is shown in the
  tree and holds nothing. It is indexed as a node so the tree can say what it
  is, drawn with Inactive beside its name like any other status. Its test sets,
  test cases and runs are not read, because a project nobody is working on is
  not worth the walk.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-104** — A menu entry that cannot work on the selected row is
  gray, and says why when the pointer rests on it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-110** — Renaming a test project never writes `testin.yml`.
  The test project chosen for this code project follows the rename. When
  `testin.yml` still names the old name, Testin says so once and opens the file
  on request.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-111** — A rename closes every editor open on the node or
  under it, light mode included, before anything moves. While one of them is
  busy - a test run executing, a cell being edited - **Rename** is gray and says
  why.

## The Rename dialog

```

```

1. **One field**, filled in with the current name. Its gray hint text reads *set new name...*. The cursor sits after the
   name. So typing **adds to the
   name** instead of replacing it. `Ctrl+A` selects the whole name. Spaces at
   either end are dropped before anything else happens.

## Main flow

1. The tester selects a test project, a test set, a package or a test run.
2. The tester presses `Shift+F6`, or chooses **Actions → Rename**.
3. The **Rename** dialog opens, with the current name filled in.
4. The tester types the new name and presses `Enter`.
5. Testin closes every open editor on the node or under it, whatever kind it
   is, and light mode with them.
6. For a test project, a test set or a test set package, Testin renames the
   automation code next. It does so only while code is on: the Java plugin, and
   `testin.yml` naming the test project by its old name or its new one (Rule-CODEGEN-082).
7. Testin renames the folder.
8. For a test project, the project chosen for this code project follows the new
   name. When `testin.yml` still names the old one, a notification that stays in
   the log says *testin.yml still names \<old\>. Change testinProject to
   \<new\> there, or press Save to testin.yml in the Testin panel*, with **Save to testin.yml** and **Open testin.yml**.
   The rename itself never
   writes the file; only Save to testin.yml does (Rule-TREE-PANEL-112).
9. Testin refreshes the tree and shows *Renamed*.
10. `Ctrl+Z` puts the old name back, and Testin shows *Undone*. The automation
    code goes back with it - for the test project `testin.yml` names as well.

## What Testin refuses

**If the name is empty** — the gray hint text turns red, and the dialog stays
open.

**If the name is a path** - a name holding a slash, a backslash or `..` is
refused, reading *is a path, not a name - a node is one folder inside the one
selected*. Nothing is renamed.

**If the name is unchanged** — the dialog closes and nothing happens, silently.
Renaming `Accounts` to `  Accounts  ` counts as unchanged, because the spaces
are dropped first.

**If a sibling already has the new name** — nothing is renamed, and *\<name\>
Already Exists* is shown in red. For a test project the siblings are the other
folders in the Testin folder. A rename that only changes the case of the name is
not in its own way.

**If the automation code already has the package the new name makes** — nothing
is renamed, neither the folder nor the code, and *Package \<package\> Already
Exists* is shown in red (Rule-CODEGEN-080).

**If the IDE is indexing** — renaming a test project, a package or a test set is
refused with *Rename needs the IDE to finish indexing first*, and nothing is
renamed (Rule-CODEGEN-081). A test run has no code, and renames as usual.

**If the name cannot be a Java package** — the dialog stays open with the name
still in the box, and *'\<name\>' cannot name a Java package* is shown in red.
`New`, `Class` and `Import` are the usual ones: Java keeps those words for
itself. (Rule-TREE-PANEL-095) Only the test project and the test set
packages are asked: a test set's name becomes the class, which always ends in
`Test`, and a test run generates no code at all.

**If a container is selected** — **Rename** is gray, and `Shift+F6` does
nothing (Rule-TREE-PANEL-002).

**If an editor under the node is busy** — a test run executing, or a cell being
edited: **Rename** is gray, and says *A test run in it is executing, or a cell
is being edited. Finish it first* (Rule-TREE-PANEL-111).

**If the folder cannot be renamed on disk** — nothing is renamed and no *Renamed* is shown. An IDE notification titled
*Rename Failed* stays in the
notification log, reading *Operation failed:* and the reason, or *Could not find
path on disk:* and the path. The other refusals above are balloons that fade.
This one is not.

**If several rows are selected** — **Rename** is gray.

**If the Java plugin is not installed** — the first rename in the project shows *Java Plugin Not Available*, reading
*Automation code generation and navigation
require the Java plugin, which is not available in this IDE.* The rename still
happens. Testin says this once per project.

**If the folder cannot be renamed after the automation code was** — the code
already has the new name. Renaming again once the folder is free finishes the
job: there is no code left to move, and the folder follows.
