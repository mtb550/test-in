# UC-TREE-PANEL-029: Save the test project to testin.yml

> **Save to testin.yml**, the eighth button at the top of the panel. It has no
> key.

**As a** tester, **I want** to name the open test project in `testin.yml` with
one button, **so that** its automation code is generated here and a colleague
who opens this code project finds the same test project.

This is the only thing in Testin that writes `testin.yml`. Opening, picking,
creating, cloning, renaming, committing and pushing never do.

## Rules

- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-001** — The panel shows exactly one test project. It is the
  one this repository is bound to. There is no list of test projects in the
  tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-002** — **Test Cases** and **Test Runs** are fixed
  containers. They cannot be created, renamed, moved, copied or removed. They
  come with the test project and go with it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-003** — The tree has two sides, and nothing moves between
  them. Test sets and test set packages live under **Test Cases**. Test runs and
  test run packages live under **Test Runs**.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-004** — Two nodes under one parent cannot share a name. This
  holds whether the node is created, renamed, pasted or dropped.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-005** — A node name is never empty.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-006** — Removing, moving or copying asks first. Nothing in
  the tree changes until the tester confirms.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-007** — When something changes, Testin says so once, in the
  past tense. The tester sees *Created*, *Renamed* or *Removed*. Several changes
  made together confirm with one message and a count: the tester sees
  *Removed 4*, never four messages. Looking at something confirms nothing.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-008** — A retired node keeps everything inside it. Retired
  means a **Deprecated** test set or an **Archived** package. It is drawn gray.
  It sorts after live nodes. It is not offered when a test run is created.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-009** — A test run that is **Completed** or **Closed** is
  signed off. Its test cases, verdicts and configuration can no longer change.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-010** — Siblings are shown in one order:
    1. live nodes, then retired ones
    2. the number the tester gave the node
    3. the date the node was created
    4. the name
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-011** — A removed node goes to the desktop's recycle bin. It
  can be put back from the tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-012** — A test case is not a node in this tree. It is
  reached by opening its test set.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-013** — Nodes move only within one test project. Nothing cut
  in one test project can be pasted into another.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-099** — A node says its status beside its name when the status
  is not active. An inactive test project, a deprecated test set and an archived
  package each say which they are, in gray; a node in current work says nothing,
  because "Active" on every name is a word read a hundred times and needed
  never. A test run always says its status, because where a cycle stands is what
  the tree is read for.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-100** — A test project that is not active is shown in the
  tree and holds nothing. It is indexed as a node so the tree can say what it
  is, drawn with Inactive beside its name like any other status. Its test sets,
  test cases and runs are not read, because a project nobody is working on is
  not worth the walk.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-104** — A menu entry that cannot work on the selected row is
  gray, and says why when the pointer rests on it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-112** — Only **Save to testin.yml** writes `testin.yml`.
  Opening, picking, creating, cloning, renaming, committing and pushing never
  do.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-113** — **Save to testin.yml** names the test project open
  in the tree, and where it is cloned from when its folder is a Git repository
  with a remote - without any account or token. It shows the file and each line
  first, and writes nothing until the tester presses **Save**.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-114** — It changes only `testinProject`, `location` and
  `RepoUrl`. Every other line of the file - comments, `bugRepoUrl`, keys Testin
  does not know - stays as it was.

```

1. **The file** - the one there is, `testin.yml` or `testin.yaml`, or
   `testin.yml` in the code project's folder when there is none.
2. **Each line as it will be**, and what that changes: *was ...*, *new* or *unchanged*.
3. **The reminder** that the file is the team's: it is committed.

## Main flow

1. The tester presses **Save to testin.yml** at the top of the Testin panel.
2. Testin works out the lines. `testinProject` is the test project open in the
   tree. When its folder is a Git repository with a remote, `location: remote`
   and `RepoUrl`, the remote's address without any account or token; when it
   has no remote, `location: local`.
3. The preview opens.
4. The tester presses `Enter`. Testin writes the lines, reads the file again,
   and shows *Saved*.
5. Code turns on for this test project: generating, **Automate Test Case**, **Navigate to Test Method**, **Run Tests**,
   the gutter icons and the automated marks (Rule-CODEGEN-082).

## When code is off

Code is off while `testin.yml` does not name the test project open in the tree:
there is no file, it has no `testinProject`, or it names another. The first time
a change in the tree would have written code, a notification titled *Code Not
Generated* says why, with **Save to testin.yml**. It says so once per project.

## What Testin refuses

**If no test project is open** - the button is gray, and says *Open a test
project first: its name is what the file gets.*

**If testin.yml cannot be read** - the button is gray, and says *testin.yml
cannot be read - correct it by hand first.* Lines written into a broken file
could leave it broken, and make code look on.

**If the Git plugin is not installed** - only `testinProject` is written;
`location` and `RepoUrl` stay as they are, rather than calling a Git project
local.

**If the file cannot be written** - nothing changes, and *testin.yml could not
be saved. The log says why.* is shown in red.

**If the tester presses Escape** - nothing is written.
