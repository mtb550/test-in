# UC-TREE-PANEL-021: Re-create a test run

> **No key.** On the menu: **Actions → Re-create**.

**As a** tester, **I want** to make the next cycle from a finished test run,
with the same test cases and settings and no verdicts, **so that** starting the
next round of testing takes one step, instead of building the whole test run
again by hand.

## Rules

- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-001** — The panel shows exactly one test project. It is the
  one this repository is bound to. There is no list of test projects in the
  tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-002** — **Test Cases** and **Test Runs** are fixed
  containers. They cannot be created, renamed, moved, copied or removed. They
  come with the test project and go with it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-003** — The tree has two sides, and nothing moves between
  them. Test sets and test set packages live under **Test Cases**. Test runs and
  test run packages live under **Test Runs**.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-004** — Two nodes under one parent cannot share a name. This
  holds whether the node is created, renamed, pasted or dropped.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-005** — A node name is never empty.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-006** — Removing, moving or copying asks first. Nothing in
  the tree changes until the tester confirms.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-007** — When something changes, Testin says so once, in the
  past tense. The tester sees *Created*, *Renamed* or *Removed*. Several changes
  at once confirm once, with a count: the tester sees *Removed 4*, never four
  messages. Looking at something confirms nothing.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-008** — A retired node keeps everything inside it. Retired
  means a **Deprecated** test set or an **Archived** package. It is drawn gray.
  It sorts after live nodes. It is not offered when a test run is created.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-009** — A test run that is **Completed** or **Closed** is
  signed off. Its test cases, verdicts and configuration can no longer change.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-010** — Siblings are shown in one order:
  1. live nodes, then retired ones
  2. the number the tester gave the node
  3. the date the node was created
  4. the name
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-011** — A removed node goes to the desktop's recycle bin. It
  can be put back from the tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-012** — A test case is not a node in this tree. It is
  reached by opening its test set.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-013** — Nodes move only within one test project. Nothing cut
  in one test project can be pasted into another.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-069** — Re-create works on a test run in any status,
  including a signed-off one. That is what it is for.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-070** — Only the test cases and the configuration are
  carried over. Verdicts, durations and failure details start fresh.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-071** — The next name is suggested by counting up. *cycle-1*
  becomes *cycle-2*, and a name with no number on it gets one: *smoke* becomes
  *smoke-2*. A name already taken is skipped.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-072** — The new test run is created in the same folder as
  the one it was made from.

The dialog is drawn under [UC-TREE-PANEL-009](createTestRun.md).

## Main flow

1. The tester selects a test run in any status.
2. The tester chooses **Actions → Re-create**.
3. The **Create Test Run** dialog opens, with the next name suggested: *cycle-1*
   becomes *cycle-2*. The same test cases are ticked, and the same configuration
   is filled in.
4. A test case removed from its test set since the last test run is simply not
   there.
5. The tester presses **Create**.
6. Testin writes a new test run, with every ticked test case **Pending**.
7. Its editor opens, and Testin shows *Run created*.

## What Testin refuses

The same four refusals apply as when a test run is created.

**If no test case is ticked** — the **Create** button is disabled.

**If the name is empty** — *A test run needs a name* is shown, and the dialog
stays open with everything typed still in it.

**If the name is already used** — *\<name\> Already Exists* is shown, and the
dialog stays open with everything typed still in it.

**If the folder was removed while the dialog was open** — *'\<parent\>' no
longer exists - test run not created* is shown in red.

**If several rows are selected** — **Re-create** is gray. It needs exactly one.
