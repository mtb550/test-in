# UC-TREE-PANEL-026: Switch the Git branch of the test project

> **No key.** Pick a branch from the box above the tree.

**As a** tester, **I want** to switch the test project's branch from the panel,
**so that** the tree follows the branch I am testing.

The box above the tree appears for a test project whose folder is a Git
repository.

## Rules

- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-001** — The panel shows exactly one test project. It is the
  one this repository is bound to. There is no list of test projects in the
  tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-002** — **Test Cases** and **Test Runs** are fixed
  containers. They cannot be created, renamed, moved, copied or removed. They
  come with the test project and go with it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-003** — The tree has two sides, and nothing moves between
  them. Test sets and test set packages live under **Test Cases**. Test runs and
  test run packages live under **Test Runs**.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-004** — Two nodes under one parent cannot share a name. This
  holds whether the node is created, renamed, pasted or dropped.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-005** — A node name is never empty.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-006** — Removing, moving or copying asks first. Nothing in
  the tree changes until the tester confirms.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-007** — When something changes, Testin says so once, in the
  past tense. The tester sees *Created*, *Renamed* or *Removed*. Several changes
  at once confirm once, with a count: the tester sees *Removed 4*, never four
  messages. Looking at something confirms nothing.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-008** — A retired node keeps everything inside it. Retired
  means a **Deprecated** test set or an **Archived** package. It is drawn gray.
  It sorts after live nodes. It is not offered when a test run is created.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-009** — A test run that is **Completed** or **Closed** is
  signed off. Its test cases, verdicts and configuration can no longer change.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-010** — Siblings are shown in one order:
  1. live nodes, then retired ones
  2. the number the tester gave the node
  3. the date the node was created
  4. the name
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-011** — A removed node goes to the desktop's recycle bin. It
  can be put back from the tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-012** — A test case is not a node in this tree. It is
  reached by opening its test set.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-013** — Nodes move only within one test project. Nothing cut
  in one test project can be pasted into another.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-099** — A node says its status beside its name when the status
  is not active. An inactive test project, a deprecated test set and an archived
  package each say which they are, in gray; a node in current work says nothing,
  because "Active" on every name is a word read a hundred times and needed
  never. A test run always says its status, because where a cycle stands is what
  the tree is read for.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-085** — Switching with uncommitted changes asks first.
  Switching never loses them.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-086** — A switch that succeeds does a full refresh: it
  re-reads which test project is bound, reads the test project again, reloads
  every open Testin editor, and **closes any editor whose node the new branch
  does not have**.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-100** — A test project that is not active is shown in the
  tree and holds nothing. It is indexed as a node so the tree can say what it
  is - drawn with Inactive beside its name like any other status - and its test
  sets, cases and runs are not read, because a project nobody is working on is
  not worth the walk.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-104** — A menu entry that cannot work on the selected row is
  gray, and says why when the pointer rests on it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-108** — The branch box appears when the test project's
  folder is a Git repository, with or without a `testin.yml`. The file can only
  take it away, by saying the project is shared through an SFTP server, which
  has no branches.

## The Uncommitted Changes dialog

```

1. **How many changes** — and the one sentence that matters. Switching does
   not leave the changes behind. They come with the tester. They can be
   committed onto the wrong branch by mistake.
2. **From** and **To** — the branch the tester is on, and the branch they
   picked.
3. **Two confirms** — `Enter` switches anyway. `Shift+Enter` opens the review
   instead.

## Main flow

1. The test project's folder is a Git repository.
   A drop-down box above the tree lists its branches in alphabetical order. The
   current branch is selected. Remote branches are listed too, without their
   `remotes/` prefix.
2. The tester picks another branch. A progress bar reads *Checking branch
   \<branch\>*, then *Checking out branch: \<branch\>*.
3. Testin checks out the branch. A remote branch with no local branch yet gets
   one, and the new local branch follows it. The message then names the local
   branch.
4. Testin does a full refresh, and shows *Switched to \<branch\>*. An editor
   whose node the new branch does not have is closed.

The box fills itself from what is on the machine, showing *Reading branches*.
That is the whole answer to almost every question anyone asks it, and it needs
no network.

Three things also ask the remote, and then the box fills a second time showing
*Fetching from remote*, so the list can grow a moment after it appears:
**Refresh**, a branch switch, and opening a different test project. Nothing else
does. A rename, a removal or a status change rebuilds the panel without going
near the remote - it cannot have moved a branch, and a fetch can stop to ask for
credentials or sit on a host that is not reachable.

**With uncommitted changes**

1. The box goes back to the branch the tester was on.
2. The **Uncommitted Changes** dialog says how many changes there are, and that
   they would move to the new branch too.
3. `Enter`, which is **Switch Anyway**, runs the switch as above.
4. `Shift+Enter`, which is **Review Changes**, opens the list of changes not yet
   committed instead.
5. `Escape` changes nothing.

## What Testin refuses

**If the test project's folder is not a Git repository** — there is no box, and
*Not a Git repository* is shown in its place. **If `testin.yml` says the project
is shared through an SFTP server** — there is no box, and *Not shared through
Git* is shown in its place.

**If Git refuses the checkout** — the box goes back to the branch the tester was
on. An IDE notification titled *Branch Not Switched* opens. It says *\<branch\>
was not checked out. There are uncommitted changes in this test project that
switching would overwrite - commit them first.* It carries a **Review Changes**
link.

**If the branches cannot be read** — the box reads *Failed to load branches* and
cannot be opened. An IDE notification titled *Git Error* gives the reason.

**If the repository has no branches** — the box reads *No branches found* and
cannot be opened.

**If Git is on no branch at all** — the box lists the branches and shows none of
them selected. A checkout of a tag or a commit made outside Testin, a bisect, or
a rebase stopped partway all leave the repository like this, and there is no
branch to name. Picking one from the list switches to it, which is the way out.

**While the branches are still loading** — the box reads *Loading branches...*
and cannot be opened.
