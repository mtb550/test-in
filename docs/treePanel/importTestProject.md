# UC-TREE-PANEL-003: Import a test project that already exists

> **No key.** Press **New Test Project** at the top of the panel, and paste
> the address instead of a name.

**As a** tester, **I want** to bring a test project that already exists
somewhere else onto this machine, **so that** I can work on it without building
it again by hand.

This copies a test project from Git onto this machine.

## Rules

- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-001** — The panel shows exactly one test project. It is the
  one this repository is bound to. There is no list of test projects in the
  tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-002** — **Test Cases** and **Test Runs** are fixed
  containers. They cannot be created, renamed, moved, copied or removed. They
  come with the test project and go with it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-003** — The tree has two sides, and nothing moves between
  them. Test sets and test set packages live under **Test Cases**. Test runs and
  test run packages live under **Test Runs**.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-004** — Two nodes under one parent cannot share a name. This
  holds whether the node is created, renamed, pasted or dropped.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-005** — A node name is never empty.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-006** — Removing, moving or copying asks first. Nothing in
  the tree changes until the tester confirms.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-007** — When something changes, Testin says so once, in the
  past tense. The tester sees *Created*, *Renamed* or *Removed*. Several changes
  made together confirm with one message and a count: the tester sees
  *Removed 4*, never four messages. Looking at something confirms nothing.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-008** — A retired node keeps everything inside it. Retired
  means a **Deprecated** test set or an **Archived** package. It is drawn gray.
  It sorts after live nodes. It is not offered when a test run is created.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-009** — A test run that is **Completed** or **Closed** is
  signed off. Its test cases, verdicts and configuration can no longer change.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-010** — Siblings are shown in one order:
  1. live nodes, then retired ones
  2. the number the tester gave the node
  3. the date the node was created
  4. the name
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-011** — A removed node goes to the desktop's recycle bin. It
  can be put back from the tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-012** — A test case is not a node in this tree. It is
  reached by opening its test set.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-013** — Nodes move only within one test project. Nothing cut
  in one test project can be pasted into another.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-099** — A node says its status beside its name when the status
  is not active. An inactive test project, a deprecated test set and an archived
  package each say which they are, in gray; a node in current work says nothing,
  because "Active" on every name is a word read a hundred times and needed
  never. A test run always says its status, because where a cycle stands is what
  the tree is read for.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-100** — A test project that is not active is shown in the
  tree and holds nothing. It is indexed as a node so the tree can say what it
  is, drawn with Inactive beside its name like any other status. Its test sets,
  cases and runs are not read, because a project nobody is working on is not
  worth the walk.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-104** — A menu entry that cannot work on the selected row is
  gray, and says why when the pointer rests on it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-107** — Cloning needs the Git plugin, and nothing else: a
  code project clones a test project whether it has a `testin.yml` or not. The
  clone is named after its repository, the last part of the address without
  `.git`. That name is kept as it is when Testin accepts it as a test project's
  name, made into one otherwise, and numbered when the Testin folder already
  has it. The one exception is the address `testin.yml` gives: that clone takes
  the name the file gives beside it.

## What the tester sees

The **Create Project** dialog opens. It is the same one-field dialog a new test
project uses, and it is drawn under
[UC-TREE-PANEL-002](createTestProject.md). While Git copies the repository, a
progress bar reads *Cloning repository*, with the line *Cloning into
\<name\>...* under it. The tree then appears, and *Project cloned* shows above
the status bar at the bottom right of the IDE.

## Main flow

There is a second way in. The code project may name a test project that is not
on this machine. The panel then offers the link **Clone \<name\>**. That link is
drawn under [UC-TREE-PANEL-001](reachTheTree.md), and it does the same thing.

**From a Git address**

1. The Git plugin is installed. This code project needs no `testin.yml`.
2. The tester presses the **New Test Project** button in the panel header.
3. The tester pastes the repository address instead of a name, and presses
   `Enter`.
4. Testin copies the repository into the Testin folder. The new folder is
   named after the repository: `https://github.com/acme/nafath-test-cases.git`
   becomes `nafath-test-cases`, and a second clone of it `nafath-test-cases2`.
   A progress bar reads *Cloning repository*, with the line *Cloning into
   \<name\>...*. It cannot be canceled.
5. Testin chooses it for this code project on this machine, and the tree
   appears. Nothing is written into the code project (Rule-TREE-PANEL-106).
6. Testin shows *Project cloned*. The name can be changed afterward with
   **Rename** ([UC-TREE-PANEL-011](renameNode.md)).

## What Testin refuses

**If the address is the one `testin.yml` gives, and a folder of the name it
gives is already in the Testin folder** — nothing is cloned, and *\<name\>
Already Exists* is shown in red. That folder is the one the file means.

**If the Git plugin is not installed** — nothing is cloned. Testin shows *Git
Plugin Not Available*, reading *Git synchronization and cloning require the Git
plugin, which is not available in this IDE.* Testin checks this before anything
else.

**If no Testin folder is set** — the **New Test Project** button is gray, and
says *Set the Testin folder in Settings first.* (Rule-TREE-PANEL-115)
