# UC-TREE-PANEL-022: Edit a test run

> **`F2`** in the tree, or **Edit Test Run** on the menu. Saving is final:
> **`Ctrl+Z`** does not take it back.

> `F2` changes the thing in front of the tester, and which thing that is depends

> Failed Test Case Details in the run editor, and this one in the tree. Each is

**As a** tester, **I want** to change which test cases a test run covers, its
name and its configuration, **so that** a test run can be corrected without
being recreated.

This changes a test run that is not signed off yet.

## Rules

- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-001** — The panel shows exactly one test project. It is the
  one this repository is bound to. There is no list of test projects in the
  tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-002** — **Test Cases** and **Test Runs** are fixed
  containers. They cannot be created, renamed, moved, copied or removed. They
  come with the test project and go with it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-003** — The tree has two sides, and nothing moves between
  them. Test sets and test set packages live under **Test Cases**. Test runs and
  test run packages live under **Test Runs**.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-004** — Two nodes under one parent cannot share a name. This
  holds whether the node is created, renamed, pasted or dropped.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-005** — A node name is never empty.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-006** — Removing, moving or copying asks first. Nothing in
  the tree changes until the tester confirms.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-007** — When something changes, Testin says so once, in the
  past tense. The tester sees *Created*, *Renamed* or *Removed*. Several changes
  made together confirm with one message and a count: the tester sees
  *Removed 4*, never four messages. Looking at something confirms nothing.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-008** — A retired node keeps everything inside it. Retired
  means a **Deprecated** test set or an **Archived** package. It is drawn gray.
  It sorts after live nodes. It is not offered when a test run is created.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-009** — A test run that is **Completed** or **Closed** is
  signed off. Its test cases, verdicts and configuration can no longer change.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-010** — Siblings are shown in one order:
    1. live nodes, then retired ones
    2. the number the tester gave the node
    3. the date the node was created
    4. the name
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-011** — A removed node goes to the desktop's recycle bin. It
  can be put back from the tree.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-012** — A test case is not a node in this tree. It is
  reached by opening its test set.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-013** — Nodes move only within one test project. Nothing cut
  in one test project can be pasted into another.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-099** — A node says its status beside its name when the status
  is not active. An inactive test project, a deprecated test set and an archived
  package each say which they are, in gray; a node in current work says nothing,
  because "Active" on every name is a word read a hundred times and needed
  never. A test run always says its status, because where a cycle stands is what
  the tree is read for.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-073** — A signed-off test run cannot be edited. (Rule-TREE-PANEL-009)
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-074** — Removing a test case from a test run drops
  everything that test case recorded in that test run. Adding a test case adds
  it as **Pending**.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-076** — A test case this dialog does not show is not one the
  tester chose to remove. That is a test case deleted from its test set after
  the test run was made, and one in a test set deprecated, or under a package
  archived, since then. What the test run recorded about it is kept, and saving
  the dialog never removes it.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-093** — The dialog opens with every row saying what the run
  actually covers, folders included. A folder is ticked only when everything
  under it is ticked, so a folder is never ticked over test cases the run does
  not cover.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-100** — A test project that is not active is shown in the
  tree and holds nothing. It is indexed as a node so the tree can say what it
  is, drawn with Inactive beside its name like any other status. Its test sets,
  test cases and runs are not read, because a project nobody is working on is
  not worth the walk.
- **Rule-TREE-PANEL-104** — A menu entry that cannot work on the selected row is
  gray, and says why when the pointer rests on it.

## What the tester sees

The **Edit Test Run** dialog opens. It is the dialog drawn under
[UC-TREE-PANEL-009](createTestRun.md), with two differences. Its title reads **Edit Test Run**, and its button reads
**Save**. It arrives filled in with the
test run's own name, its test cases and its configuration. After **Save**, the
tree refreshes and *Updated* shows above the status bar at the bottom right of
the IDE.

## Main flow

1. The tester selects a test run that is not signed off.
2. The tester chooses **Edit Test Run**.
3. The **Edit Test Run** dialog opens. It shows the test run's name, its test
   cases already ticked, and its configuration already filled in. Test cases
   added to a test set since the test run was created appear unticked.
4. The tester changes any of it and presses **Save**.
5. If the name was changed, Testin closes the test run's editor first. It then
   renames the folder, and only then saves the test run.
6. Testin removes any test case the tester unticked, with everything the test
   run recorded about it. A newly ticked test case is added as **Pending**.
7. The tree refreshes, and Testin shows *Updated*.
8. The edit is final. It is not put on the tree's history, so `Ctrl+Z` does not
   take it back (Rule-TREE-PANEL-060).

## What Testin refuses

**If the test run is Completed or Closed** — **Edit Test Run** is gray.

**If the test run was signed off from its editor while the dialog was open** —
the dialog stays open, and *'\<run\>' was Completed while this was open -
nothing saved* is shown in red.

**If the test run was removed while the dialog was open** — *'\<run\>' no longer
exists - nothing saved* is shown in red.

**If the name is emptied** — *A test run needs a name* is shown in red, and the
dialog stays open.

**If the new name is already used by a sibling** — *\<name\> Already Exists* is
shown in red, and the dialog stays open. Keeping the test run's own name is not
a clash.

**If the last test case is unticked** — **Save** is disabled. **Create** does
the same on an empty new test run.

**If several rows are selected** — **Edit Test Run** is gray. It needs exactly one.
