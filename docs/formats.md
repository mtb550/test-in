# The formats on disk

> Everything Testin stores is a plain file you can open. There are ten formats,
> all of them JSON except one YAML and the screenshots, which are PNG. This page
> is the contract for every one — what a field means, which are required, and
> what a reader must do with a field it does not recognize.

| **Checked against** | `main` at `1270e599`, 20 September 2026 — every marker, the test case, the result and `testin.yml` read field by field against the new file structure (#305), and the committed sample under `samples/testin-root` read against this page.

| **Written to**      | [The standard](standard.md), as far as it applies.

**A marker is a file whose whole name is the extension.** `.ts`, not `foo.ts`.
A directory is a test set because it holds a file called `.ts`, and that is the
only thing that makes it one — the folder name is the node's name and carries no
meaning beyond it.

**The names `Test Cases` and `Test Runs` are fixed.** They are the folder
names of `DirectoryType.TCD` and `DirectoryType.TRD` and a test project has
exactly one of each.

## What is true of every JSON file

|                      |                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encoding**         | UTF-8, pretty-printed with two spaces, and a space either side of the colon — Jackson's default pretty printer, unchanged                      |
| **Unknown fields**   | Ignored, never an error. Every type carries `@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)`                                                      |
| **Missing fields**   | Take the field's default, which is always an empty value of its own type — never null                                                          |
| **Dates**            | `EEEE dd-MM-yyyy 'At' HH:mm:ss '['VV']'` in `en_US`, for example `Friday 28-08-2026 At 01:12:47 [Asia/Riyadh]`. The zone is part of the value  |
| **"Never happened"** | The Unix epoch in UTC, `Thursday 01-01-1970 At 00:00:00 [Z]` — `Config.NOT_EXECUTED`. Not a missing field, and not null                        |
| **Enums**            | Written by constant name in capitals. A name this build does not know is a read failure for that file, not a silent default — see *Versioning* |

## The seven markers

Every marker shares the same six fields, from `AbstractMarker`, and most add a
`status` of their own.

### Shared by all seven

| Field        | Type        | Required                    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `id`         | UUID string | no, **omitted while empty** | The folder's own id. Stamped the first time Testin writes the marker and never changed after — not by a rename, a move, a status or an order change, or a merge — and fresh on a copied folder, because a copy is another folder. A marker written before ids has none and is stamped the next time anything writes it. One marker writer stamps them, and it refuses to write over a marker file that is there and will not parse, so a damaged marker is left for the tester to repair rather than replaced by defaults with an id on top (Rule-INTERNAL-083). Nothing in the plugin reads the id: it names a project, a set or a run for a tool outside the IDE (Rule-INTERNAL-090) |
| `order`      | integer     | no                          | Where the node sits among its siblings. **Omitted entirely when the node is unordered**, which is `Integer.MAX_VALUE` in memory — an absent `order` is the normal case, not a defect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

**A blank `modifiedBy` reads back as `createdBy`, and a blank `modifiedAt` as
`createdAt`** — a node that was never modified was last touched when it was
made. The answer is given once, in `AbstractMarker`, so nothing downstream tests
for it, and what is written back is that answer rather than an invented one.

**A directory carrying two markers of one family is read as the more specific
one.** Under `Test Cases` the order is `.ts` then `.tsp`; under `Test Runs` it is
`.tr` then `.trp` — a set is what holds test cases and a package is what holds
sets. `DirectoryType.UNDER_TEST_CASES` and `UNDER_TEST_RUNS` are that
precedence, and nothing else may ask in a different order.

**The test run marker adds four more**, because they are facts about the run
rather than about any one result. They are what it was executed against, what
the tester wrote about the verdicts afterward, and when execution started and
last stopped. They are the run's, so they are in the run's own file:

## A test case — `<uuid>.tc`

One file per test case, inside its test set. **Any `.tc` file directly inside
a test set is a test case** (Rule-INTERNAL-011), so `login.tc` written by hand
is read as one and a copy of it is given an id of its own; a `.tc` sitting in
`Test Cases` rather than in a set is not a test case at all. The file holds
JSON; the name says what the JSON is, so nothing has to look inside to find
out.

Testin writes the file as `<id>.tc`, and a hand-named one is filed under its
id the next time anything writes it, the hand-named file going once that write
has landed (Rule-INTERNAL-084). The two names answer different questions:
the **file name** is what the tree shows (Rule-INTERNAL-012 — a `name` field
inside the file would not decide it), and the **`id` field** is what a test run's
recorded result points at.

**`order` is a rank, not a number.** `"zo"` is a valid order and sorts as text.
A test case carries where it sits, not who its neighbors are; the earlier
design gave each test case a `previous` and a `next`, so every insertion,
deletion and reorder rewrote a file the tester had not touched — which is what
made two people working in parallel conflict on a third person's test case, and
what let one lost pointer leave a whole set unordered.

**An empty `order` means "not placed yet"** — imported, copied in, or arrived
from a merge. Those sort after the placed test cases, oldest first, and are
given a rank the next time anything writes them. It is not an error and must
not be repaired on read.

There is **no separate sequence file.** `TestCaseSequenceStore` is an in-memory
index the plugin builds while scanning; the order on disk is the `order` field
on each test case and nothing else.

## A result — `<test case id>.ri`

One file per test case the run covers, inside the run's folder, beside its
`.tr`. A test case appears in a run once, so the test case's id is the file's
name and two testers adding the same test case offline write the same file
rather than two.

It records what was executed, not what exists: a test case removed from the
test set keeps its result here. What the run itself is - how it was configured,
what the tester wrote about the verdicts, when it was executed - is in its
`.tr`, with its status.

The results are read in the order their test cases sit in their test sets, and
a result whose test case the project no longer holds comes last. So a report
prints them in the order a tester reads the tree, never in the order a folder
listing happens to give.

**A result file goes only when the run stops covering its test case.**
Unticking a test case in Edit Test Run removes that one `.ri`, and nothing else
in the folder is touched. A `.ri` the run in memory does not cover is left
exactly where it is: it can be one a pull brought a moment ago, or one a failed
write could not produce, and removing either would lose a verdict nobody asked
to lose. Writing a verdict writes the one file it is about, so two testers
judging different test cases of one run never touch the same file.

**A result is known by its file name** (Rule-INTERNAL-094). A `.ri` whose name
is not a test case id, `login-result.ri` renamed by hand for one, is not read:
the scan names it in a warning, and nothing writes a second file for it.
Renamed to its test case's id, it is read again at the next Refresh.

The screenshots a failure names sit in the same folder, one PNG each, named by
five random lowercase letters and digits that no result of the run already holds

- `k3f9a.png`. Testin writes a screenshot before the result that names it, and
  moves one that no result of the run names anymore to the recycle bin after the
  next write. Any PNG in a run folder named that way is taken for a screenshot, so
  one put there by hand under such a name goes too.

`EMPTY` is a real constant, not a missing value. A passed test case carries
`"bugSeverity" : "EMPTY"`, and nothing reading it has to test for absence.

## `testin.yml` — the automation repository's own file

The one file that lives in the code repository rather than under the Testin
folder, and the only one that is **committed**. It is the team's: Testin reads
it when it is there, and **writes it only when the tester presses Save to
testin.yml** (Rule-TREE-PANEL-112). A code project without one works fully,
except that its automation code stays off until the file names the open test
project (Rule-INTERNAL-089, Rule-CODEGEN-082, Decision-013). What it adds is agreement - a
colleague who clones the repository lands on the same test project with no
setup. `testin.yaml` is read too.

| Key             | Type               | Required             | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `location`      | `local` / `remote` | no, defaults `local` | Whether the test data is on this machine or cloned from Git, the only way a test project is shared                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `RepoUrl`       | string             | only when remote     | **Kept as it is written.** Whether the text is a repository address at all is decided where something is about to clone it (Rule-TREE-PANEL-117), so a value Testin does not recognize stays in the file to be seen and corrected rather than being dropped as it is read. Any account and token are dropped as it is read: on an `https://` or `http://` address every account goes, because there it is the secret; on an `ssh://` address only `account:secret` goes, so the conventional `git@` survives (Rule-SHARE-004) |
| `testinProject` | string             | no                   | Which test project, for everyone who opens the code project. Without it each tester chooses one, kept on their own machine; with it, a tester's own choice still wins until the file names a different project (Rule-TREE-PANEL-106)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `bugRepoUrl`    | string             | only to report bugs  | The GitHub repository [Report Bug](viewPanel/reportBug.md) files issues in, as its address: `https://github.com/owner/repo`, `https://host/owner/repo.git`, `ssh://git@host:2222/owner/repo` or `git@host:owner/repo`. Any account and token in it are dropped as it is read, by the same rule as `RepoUrl`. An address that does not name exactly a host, an owner and a repository - one ending in `/issues`, a file or a local path - is kept, and Report Bug refuses to send with the reason                              |

**No machine or person appears here.** The Testin folder, the tester's
name and the log level are application settings, and the test
project a tester chose is kept on their machine — see `CLAUDE.md`, and
Decision-011 on [the decisions page](decisions.md). An unknown key is logged
and skipped, never fatal - which is what happens to `connection` and the
`sftp` keys a file written before Decision-012 still carries.

```yaml
location: local
testinProject: NAFATH
```

## Versioning

**A reader ignores what it does not know.** Every JSON type carries
`@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)` and the YAML reader logs an
unknown key and skips it. Adding a field is therefore always safe: an older
build reading a newer file drops the field, and writes the file back without it.
That is the trade — forward compatibility is a *read*, not a round trip.

**A writer never removes or renames a field without a conversion.** When a name
has to change, the old one stays readable through `@JsonAlias` — `modifiedBy`
and `modifiedAt` are read from `updatedBy` and `updatedAt` for exactly this
reason, and those aliases are permanent.

**The project says which format its files are in**, in its `.tp`: `format`, and
2 is the format this page describes. A project without the number, or with a
lower one, is not read at all: it is shown refused and named the one release
that brings it forward, 2.13.0-alpha, which moved its test cases to `<id>.tc`,
gave every marker an `id` and removed its test runs
([UC-INTERNAL-002](internal/readTestProject.md), Rule-INTERNAL-091). A project
with a **higher** number is not read at all: a format this build does not know is
refused rather than guessed at, because reading it as format 2 would delete what
this build cannot see.

**A file whose shape changed structurally is not read at all.** A test run
written before 3 September 2026 kept its results in `<folder>.json`, and one
written before 20 September 2026 kept them all in a `run.json`. Neither is read:
such a run shows no results, and the conversion removes the run rather than
carrying it forward. That is a decision, not an oversight, and
`FormatConversionIdeTest.testAnOldProjectBecomesThisFormat` asserts it so it
cannot be mistaken for one.

**An unknown enum constant fails that file's read.** It is not defaulted,
because a status quietly becoming `PENDING` loses a tester's decision without
saying so. This is the one incompatibility that needs a conversion story before
it ships. [#91 and #92](https://github.com/mtb550/test-in/issues/91) exist
because a format changed and the rule for old data had to be decided after the
fact. That is the thing this page is here to prevent.

**Old data gets wiped, not migrated.** When a change cannot be made compatible,
the answer is to delete the old data and start again rather than to ship a
converter. The trees are small, and a converter is a second reader of a format
nobody writes anymore.

**The one exception is the conversion to format 2**, which 2.13.0-alpha carries
because the plugin is public. Test cases and markers are brought forward, and
only the test runs are removed (#305, D4). The conversion code is deleted in
2.14.0-alpha, which is why the number is in the file - from then on a project
nobody converted is refused, naming the release that can convert it.
