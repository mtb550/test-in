# UC-SHARE-017: Resolve the conflicts a pull stopped on

**As a** tester, **I want** to settle a file two of us changed,
**so that** the pull can finish and neither of us loses work.

A conflict is a file two people changed since they last agreed. The pull stops
until somebody says which change wins.

There is no key for this. The offer appears on the message.

## Rules

- **Rule-SHARE-001** — An export never changes any test case. It only reads.
- **Rule-SHARE-002** — An import never overwrites an existing test case. Every
  imported test case is new.
- **Rule-SHARE-003** — A sync sends and takes in one gesture, so a sync that
  succeeded never leaves the tester's work only on this machine.
- **Rule-SHARE-004** — A password is never written to a file Testin writes, and
  never to the log.
- **Rule-SHARE-005** — Long work runs under a progress bar. A Git step that
  only reads can be canceled; one that is writing to the repository or to the
  remote cannot, because a push or a rebase stopped half way leaves the
  repository in a state nobody asked for. The export, import and report ones can
  be canceled: none of them leaves anything the tester cannot see.
- **Rule-SHARE-006** — Nothing here is in the IDE's keymap, so none of these
  keys can be changed there.
- **Rule-SHARE-074** — A merged test case Git will not stage is reported to the
  tester, with what to do about it. The sync cannot go on without it.

- **Rule-SHARE-075** — A pull that stops leaves the repository part way through,
  and Testin says so rather than leaving the tester to find out.
- **Rule-SHARE-076** — Three answers are offered: let Testin settle the test
  cases field by field and then carry on, carry on without merging anything, or
  roll the whole pull back.
- **Rule-SHARE-077** — Rolling back keeps everything that was here before the
  pull.
- **Rule-SHARE-078** — Where both sides changed different fields of one test
  case, Testin merges them and asks only about the fields that really disagree.
- **Rule-SHARE-109** — Two fields are settled rather than asked about, and the
  dialog says so. Who changed the test case last, and when, take the later of
  the two edits; the order takes the remote's. Neither is a question a tester
  can usefully answer about a merge, so the answer is given and named rather
  than asked for.
- **Rule-SHARE-079** — A pull that will not move on is said again: the **Git
  Conflicts** message comes back, naming the files still in the way.

## What the tester sees

No window opens first. A warning message appears at the bottom right of the
IDE, titled **Git Conflicts**, naming the files both sides changed. It waits in
the IDE's notification list, and three links sit under it: **Resolve**,
**Continue rebase** and **Abort rebase**.

## Main flow

1. The tester syncs, and the pull stops on a conflict.
2. A message titled **Git Conflicts** reads *Both sides changed*, names the
   files, then *Resolve the conflict, then continue - or abort to roll the pull
   back and keep what is here.*
3. The tester chooses to carry on.
4. Testin merges each conflicting test case, one field at a time.
5. For any field both sides rewrote, the tester is asked which one wins. That is
   [UC-SHARE-018](answerMergeQuestions.md).
6. The merged files are given back to Git and the pull carries on.
7. The sync ends the way one that never stopped does: a message titled
   **Synced** reads *Pushed* and the count, or *Up to date with the remote*.

A push from **Pending Changes** that stops on a conflict ends differently, with a
message titled **Rebase continued** reading *Changes pushed to the remote*.

## What Testin refuses

**If the tester chooses to roll back** — a message titled **Rebase aborted**
reads *The pull was rolled back*, or *Nothing was pushed*. Everything that was
here before the pull is still here.

**If the roll back fails** — a message titled **Git Conflict Operation Failed**
reads *Could not abort the rebase.*

**If carrying on fails** — the same title, reading *Could not continue the
rebase.*

**If conflicts remain after the merge** — the conflict offer opens again, naming
what is still in the way, with the same three links: Resolve, Continue and
Abort. It used to name them under a plain warning when the tester had come from
Pending Commits, and offer the three links only when they had come from Sync -
the same situation answered two ways, and the way out on screen only once.

**A result two testers judged** — kept whole from whoever judged it last. A
verdict is one tester's account of executing one case: the status, when they
gave it, what they saw, the stacktrace, the screenshots and the bug they filed.
Those travel together or they say something nobody recorded, so the later
`executedAt` takes the file and nothing is asked. Nothing is said either: the
line naming what was settled belongs to the merge window, and that window opens
only when a question is left. That is difference 20. Two testers judging
**different** cases of one run never conflict at all: their verdicts are in
different files.

**A run two testers executed** — merged by rule, with nothing to answer: the run
started when the earlier of the two says it started, ended when the later says it
ended, its status is the one further along, and its audit block takes the later
edit. What they each wrote - the configuration, the result analysis - merges key
by key, and only a key both of them changed differently is a question.

**If the conflicted file is none of those** — a folder's marker other than a
run's, or anything Testin did not write, is named in that same message and left
as it is. The tester settles those by hand, in files the IDE may not draw as
conflicted, because a Testin folder is not a version control root.

**If the repository has no remote** — the rebase is carried to the end and the
push is refused, reading *This repository has no remote, so there is nothing to
push to*.

**If a merged file cannot be written** — a message titled **Merge Failed** reads
*Could not write*, the path, then the reason.

**If a merged file Git will not take** — a message titled **Merge Not
Accepted** names the file and says what to do: resolve that file in Git, then
sync again. The sync cannot go on without it.

## Some things are settled without asking, and the dialog says which

The order of a test case takes the remote's value. Who changed it last, and
when, take the later of the two edits. Neither is a question a tester can
usefully answer about a merge - a position is not something either of them
chose, and who edited last is already in the two timestamps.

So they are not asked, and the dialog lists what was decided, one line and one
finished sentence for each:

> **Both changed these, and Testin settled them without asking:**
> Who changed it last and when, taken from the later edit
> The position in the test set, taken from the remote

Each entry carries its own reason, because the reasons differ: a run's marker
settles its status, its execution stamps and every key only one tester wrote, and
none of those is settled by a rule about positions. The dialog adds nothing to
them - it used to end the sentence with one explanation for the lot, which was
true of a test case and of nothing else.

Only when it happened. A field one side never touched is settled by the ordinary
three-way rule, which is nobody's decision, and nothing is said about it.

Only when the window opens, too. A file the merge settles whole leaves nothing
to answer, so no window opens and the list is never shown. That is difference
20.
